Now that I take methylo I feel big changes in how I function during the cycle.  Like last  10 days of the cycle, my medication kind of stops working... That is like 1/3 of the time.  I know it's still better than without meds nevertheless, it makes establishing a routine quite challenging. My doc suggested trying contraceptive pills, but I am not even sexually active ATM so taking more medication, with potential side effects,  does not excite me.\n\nI know there are herbs that are proven to be helping with regulating the cycle but I don't know if they would help with ADHD symptoms?

The women in the first group were treated by Fomentex (Foeniculum vulgare / Mentha longifolia / Vitex agnus-castus) herbal tea 11.2 g/day in 2 divided doses for 2 weeks and the second group were treated by medroxy progesterone acetate (MP)10 mg/day for the last 10 days of their menstrual cycles. The intervention was repeated in three cycles of menstruation in both groups. Bleeding pattern was documented by the patient on diary cards. The occurrence (yes/no) of bleeding, the regularity of bleeding pattern, the interval of cycles, the duration of bleeding, the volume of blood flow, the hormonal parameters (total testosterone, free testosterone luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone), and the endometrial thickness in sonography before and after the intervention were evaluated and compared as outcomes.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThe number of women with bleeding during the first cycle was in the Fomentex group and the MP group 83.3% and 94.1% respectively (p = 0.61). The regularity of bleeding did not significantly differ in patients treated with Fomentex from those given MP (66.7% vs. 94.1%; p = 0.088). Mean interval of cycles decreased in both groups after intervention (P<0.001). Mean duration decreased significantly in MP group after the intervention but it was not different in patients treated with Fomentex. The difference between 2 groups was not significant (P=0.705). Volume of blood flow, with regard to Pictorial Blood Assessment Chart (PBAC), increased significantly in MP group after the intervention (P=0.001) and it was not different in patients treated with Fomentex (P=0.757); however, difference between 2 groups was not significant (P=0.063). The percentage of patients with on time menstruation in the next (drug-free) episode, was higher in the Fomentex group compared with the MP group (50% vs. 23.5%; p = 0.105). Secondary outcomes such as dysmenorrhea, acne and hirsutism reduced in the Fomentex group (P\u22640.05), while they increased in the MP group (P=0.007). At the end of the treatment, there was a significant decrease in luteinizing hormone, total testosterone and free testosterone in patients taking Fomentex. The decrease of endometrial thickness, was significant in both groups after the intervention (P=0.001), but the difference between 2 groups was not significant (P=0.58). No notable complication or side effect was reported in relation to Fomentex.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nFomentex herbal tea is a safe, well-tolerated, and effective choice in inducing bleeding and maintaining regular bleeding in women with oligo/amenorrhea.","t2":"The efficacy of Femal in women with premenstrual syndrome: a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicentre study.","p2":"There was no significant difference in overall degree of PMS symptom reduction between Femal and placebo when all participating women were evaluated (P>0.05).","a2_doc":"INTRODUCTION\n\n\nA double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, parallel-group, multicentre study was conducted to evaluate the effect of a pollen-based herbal medicinal product, Femal (Sea-Band Ltd, Leicestershire, UK), on premenstrual sleep disturbances (PSD) in women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS).\nMETHODS\n\n\nFemal, 160 mg twice-daily, was given for four menstrual cycles to 50 women, and placebo to 51 women. PSD were evaluated on a visual analogue scale prior to and after the four cycles. The effect on overall PMS symptoms was assessed with the Steiner premenstrual tension syndrome (PMTS) self-rating questionnaire. The results were analysed statistically based on intention to treat.\nRESULTS\n\n\nFemal treatment resulted in a significant reduction in PSD (P<0.05) whereas placebo had no significant effect (P>0.05). In a subgroup analysis of women with irritability as their main PMS symptom cluster, the reduction of PSD was even more pronounced (P<0.001). There was no significant difference in overall degree of PMS symptom reduction between Femal and placebo when all participating women were evaluated (P>0.05). However, in women with irritability as their main PMS symptom cluster, Femal treatment resulted in a significant reduction of the Steiner score (P<0.05). The frequency of adverse events was not significantly different in women on Femal compared to women on placebo (P>0.05). No serious adverse events were recorded.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nFemal treatment reduced PSD to a significant degree, particularly in women with irritability as their main PMS symptom. Femal treatment also reduced overall PMS symptoms in women with irritability (but not dysphoria) as their main PMS symptom. The safety of Femal and its efficacy in PSD and other symptoms in women with irritability as the main symptom cluster makes this herbal medicinal product a promising addition to the therapeutic arsenal for women with PMS.","t3":"Effects of a combination of Hypericum perforatum and Vitex agnus-castus on PMS-like symptoms in late-perimenopausal women: findings from a subpopulation analysis.","p3":"The active treatment group also showed significant reductions in the anxiety (p = 0.003) and hydration (p = 0.002) clusters, using paired-samples t tests.","a3_doc":"BACKGROUND\n\n\nIt has been suggested that some of the symptoms typically attributed to menopause may be more related to premenstrual syndrome (PMS) than menopause, as perimenopausal women appear to be more prone to PMS-like symptoms, or at least to tolerate them less well.\nOBJECTIVE\n\n\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a phytotherapeutic intervention comprising a combination of Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort) and Vitex agnus-castus (chaste tree/berry) in the management of PMS-like symptoms in perimenopausal women.\nDESIGN\n\n\nA double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel trial was conducted over 16 weeks on menopause-related symptoms. Data on PMS-like symptoms were collected at 4-weekly intervals from a small subgroup of late-perimenopausal women (n = 14) participating in this study. The primary endpoint was PMS scores measured on the Abrahams Menstrual Symptoms Questionnaire, comprising the subclusters of PMS-A (anxiety), PMS-D (depression), PMS-H (hydration), and PMS-C (cravings). Herbal combination therapy or placebo tablets were administered twice daily.\nRESULTS\n\n\nAt the end of the 16-week treatment phase, analyses of covariance showed the herbal combination to be superior to placebo for total PMS-like scores (p = 0.02), PMS-D (p = 0.006), and PMS-C clusters (p = 0.027). The active treatment group also showed significant reductions in the anxiety (p = 0.003) and hydration (p = 0.002) clusters, using paired-samples t tests. Results of trend analyses showed significant treatment group effects across the five phases for total PMS and all subscales, all in the clinically expected direction. No significant trends were evident in the placebo group.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nThese results suggest a potentially significant clinical application for this phytotherapeutic combination in PMS-like symptoms among perimenopausal women. Further research is warranted through a randomized, controlled trial dedicated to investigation of these symptoms.","t4":"Effect of Melissa officinalis Capsule on the Intensity of Premenstrual Syndrome Symptoms in High School Girl Students.","p4":"Overall, the mean score of PMS intensity in the intervention group was 42.56 + 15.73 before the intervention and changed to 32.72 \u00b1 13.24, 30.02 \u00b1 12.08, and 13.90 \u00b1 10.22 at the three consecutive months after the intervention, respectively (P = 0.001).\n","a4_doc":"BACKGROUND\n\n\nSeveral studies are conducted on Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS).

Medication was titrated up to 30 mg twice a day. Outcome measures included the ADHD Rating Scale and the Clinical Global Impression Score. Comorbid psychiatric disorders were assessed to test for potential effects on treatment outcome.\nRESULTS\n\n\nTreatment with Adderall at an average oral dose of 54 mg (administered in 2 daily doses) was effective and well tolerated. Drug-specific improvement in ADHD symptoms was highly significant overall (42% decrease on the ADHD Rating Scale, P<.001), and sufficiently robust to be detectable in a parallel groups comparison restricted to the first 3 weeks of the protocol (P<.001). The percentage of subjects who improved (reduction in the ADHD rating scale of > or =30%) was significantly higher with Adderall treatment than with a placebo (70% vs 7%; P =.001).\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nAdderall was effective and well tolerated in the short-term treatment of adults with ADHD.

Patients were admitted to the study if their current level of ADHD symptoms satisfied DSM-IV criteria (modified for use in adults), and were not currently comorbid for major mood disturbance or substance abuse. Response to medication was assessed by repeated administration of these modified DSM-IV criteria, self- and relatives' rating, as well as clinician rating using the Clinical Global Impressions Scale. More general outcome measures included the Brief Symptom Inventory and a patient satisfaction questionnaire. Medication side effects were recorded, including monitoring blood pressure and weight change. Urinalysis monitored concurrent substance usage and compliance.\nRESULTS\n\n\nDexamphetamine had a significant therapeutic response exceeding the placebo response (p = 0.045). The response was similar in both genders and across the age range. It was detected by patients, their relatives and the two clinicians. The only significant side effect was weight loss. One patient on dexamphetamine discontinued the trial because of an event possibly related to the medication.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nIn the short term, dexamphetamine appears to be efficacious in treating adult ADHD. As this is the first study in the literature, the result requires replication. Given that stimulant medication use in adult ADHD appears to be long-term, studies of long-term efficacy need to be carried out.","t4":"Treatment effects of methylphenidate on behavioral adjustment in children with mental retardation and ADHD.","p4":"RESULTS\nThe most significant improvements occurred at the 0.60 mg/kg methylphenidate dose for teacher ratings of inattention (p =.024), hyperactivity (p <.001), aggression (p <.001), and asocial behavior (p =.009).","a4_doc":"OBJECTIVE\nThe effects of stimulant medication treatment were investigated in children with mental retardation (MR) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\n\nMETHOD\nParent and teacher behavioral ratings and reports of side effects were obtained for children (N = 24, mean age = 10.9 years, SD = 2.4) during a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover treatment trial with 0.15 mg/kg, 0.30 mg/kg, and 0.60 mg/kg b.i.d. dosages of methylphenidate.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe most significant improvements occurred at the 0.60 mg/kg methylphenidate dose for teacher ratings of inattention (p =.024), hyperactivity (p <.001), aggression (p <.001), and asocial behavior (p =.009). No significant improvements, relative to placebo, occurred at the 0.15 mg/kg dosage. Of interest, nearly all significant medication-related behavioral improvements were detected by teachers. However, parents were sensitive raters of side effects, noting more sleeping problems and loss of appetite at the 0.60 mg/kg dose compared with placebo.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese results suggest that symptoms of ADHD can be treated successfully in children with ADHD/MR, and consistent with MTA study results, higher doses were most effective.

During sampling sessions, subjects received in randomized order 0 (placebo), 20, 40, and 60 mg MPH. During self-administration sessions, subjects completed a progressive ratio (PR) task to earn portions of the dose received on the corresponding sampling session. Subjective effects were recorded throughout all sessions. The main outcome measure for the study was the number of ratios completed on the PR task. Secondary measures included peak subjective effects and area-under-the-curve values for subjective effects.\nRESULTS\n\n\nCompared to the control group, the ADHD group completed more ratios on the PR task. Both groups showed robust effects of methylphenidate on subjective endpoints. Main effects of group were noted on subjective effects involving concentration and arousal.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nCompared to placebo, MPH produced reinforcing effects only for the ADHD group and not for the control group.

Here, we test the effectiveness of repurposing a drug candidate, bumetanide, on irritable behavior in a cross-disorder neurodevelopmental cohort defined by the presence of sensory reactivity problems.\nMETHODS\n\n\nParticipants, aged 5-15 years and IQ \u2265 55, with ASD, ADHD, and/or epilepsy and proven aberrant sensory reactivity according to deviant Sensory Profile scores were included. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to bumetanide (max 1 mg twice daily) or placebo tablets for 91 days followed by a 28-day wash-out period using permuted block design and minimization. Participants, parents, healthcare providers, and outcome assessors were blinded for treatment allocation. Primary outcome was the differences in ABC-irritability at day 91. Secondary outcomes were differences in SRS-2, RBS-R, SP-NL, BRIEF parent, BRIEF teacher at D91.

A secondary objective was to address the severity of side effects associated with Adderall treatment in children with ADHD using the Barkley Side Effects Questionnaire (BSEQ).\nDESIGN\n\n\nRandomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial.\nSETTING\n\n\nA large rural tertiary care clinic.\nPATIENTS\n\n\nParticipants were prospectively recruited from children 5 to 18 years of age referred for academic and/or attention problems; 154 children who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria for ADHD were enrolled. Interventions. Two doses of Adderall (0.15 mg/kg/dose and 0.3 mg/kg/dose) were compared with placebo in separate 2-week trials. Participants received each dosage regimen twice daily for 7 consecutive days.\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS\n\n\nEfficacy rates were determined by comparing Adderall with placebo during the low-dose crossover sequence and also during the high-dose crossover sequence. The criteria that defined a positive response to Adderall relative to placebo (with each patient serving as their own control) included an indication of response by at least 1 of 2 parent measures of children's behavior or at least 2 of 5 teacher measures of children's behavior. The Adderall efficacy rate was determined based on parent criteria alone, teacher criteria alone, and by a more stringent definition of response that required concurrence between parent and teacher criteria. The Adderall response rate in this study ranged from 59% when requiring concurrence between parent and teacher observers, to 82% when based on parent criteria alone. Overall, 137 of 154 participants (89%) showed a positive response by either the parent or teacher response criteria. Parents completed a modified version of the BSEQ during each week of the trial. Appetite, stomachaches, and insomnia were rated as worse by parents while children were receiving either dose of Adderall; headaches were rated as worse when children were receiving the higher dose of Adderall. Parents rated certain side effects, including staring/daydreaming, sadness, euphoria, and anxious/irritable, as worse during placebo regimens.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nWe found that Adderall is highly efficacious in our population of youth diagnosed with ADHD. In addition, Adderall is well-tolerated with a side effect profile similar to that reported for other psychostimulants.","t10":"A controlled trial of methylphenidate in adults with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and substance use disorders.","p10":"The positive response to active treatment (nine patients; 36%) was not significantly higher than that to placebo (five patients; 20%).\n","a10_doc":"AIMS\n\n\nAttention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is common among adult patients with substance use disorders.

The biomarker profile was evaluated first by comparison with that in non-dandruff subjects at baseline, and then to determine whether any treatment-induced changes were correlated with reductions in flaking in dandruff sufferers.\nRESULTS\n\n\nTaken together, our studies showed that treatment with the ZPT shampoo led to an improvement in the overall scalp condition as assessed by the resolution of flaking, reduction in epidermal thickness and inflammatory biomarkers, and a dramatic improvement in biomarkers of epidermal barrier integrity.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nThe combination of biomarkers examined appears to be a good overall descriptor of the health of the scalp in dandruff, and changes in these biomarkers track with tissue-level events that underlie clinical efficacy in the treatment of dandruff by ZPT shampoo. For the first time, we demonstrate a set of tools that extend beyond flaking scores to provide insight into specific biological changes occurring on the scalp to enable an objective assessment of scalp health.","t5":"Once-daily roflumilast foam 0.3% for scalp and body psoriasis: A randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 2b study.","p5":"Patients treated with roflumilast experienced low rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) with few discontinuations due to an AE.\n","a5_doc":"BACKGROUND\n\n\nScalp psoriasis affects most patients with psoriasis but can be difficult to treat.\nOBJECTIVE\n\n\nTo evaluate efficacy and safety of once-daily roflumilast foam 0.3% on scalp and body psoriasis.\nMETHODS\n\n\nIn a phase 2b, randomized controlled trial, adults and adolescents \u226512\u2005years old with scalp and body psoriasis were randomized (2:1) to roflumilast foam 0.3% or vehicle for 8 weeks.

There is a common belief that patients frequently experience decreasing benefits over time when using a single product. This physiologic accommodation is termed tachyphylaxis.\n\n\nAIM\nTo systematically investigate the anecdotal belief that tachyphylaxis occurs in long-term treatment of SD/D using quantitative clinical assessments.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAn international questionnaire completed by 722 dermatologists assessed the belief of tachyphylaxis incidence with pyrithione zinc (PTZ)-based shampoos, time course, occurrence relative to active ingredients, and effect of switching products. Two double-blind, randomized, clinical evaluations were conducted, 24- and 48-week studies, whereby a 1% PTZ shampoo, a 2% PTZ shampoo, or a matched placebo control shampoo was used by each subject for the duration of the study. Dermatologists assessed the adherent scalp flaking (scale of 0-10) at baseline and at specified intervals.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSixty-four per cent of responding dermatologists believed tachyphylaxis occurred with PTZ products, and most felt that tachyphylaxis occurred within 3 months of use. Evaluation of mean treatment responses vs. placebo and individual responses as a function of study duration showed a consistent benefit for all products at all time points; therefore, no evidence for tachyphylaxis was found (within 48 weeks of treatment).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nNo evidence for tachyphylaxis in SD/D treatment by PTZ-based shampoos was found. Compliance could explain the decreasing response rate seen over time; the solution is to choose an affordable therapeutic product that is effective long term without cosmetic trade-offs.","t7":"Efficacy and safety of tildrakizumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3b study.","p7":"RESULTS\nOf patients treated with tildrakizumab (n = 89) vs placebo (n = 82), 49.4% vs 7.3% achieved IGA mod 2011 (scalp) response at W16 (primary endpoint) and 46.1% vs 4.9% at W12; 60.7% vs 4.9% achieved PSSI 90 response at W16 and 48.3% vs 2.4% at W12 (all P <0.00001).","a7_doc":"BACKGROUND\nScalp psoriasis is common and difficult to treat.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate efficacy and safety of tildrakizumab for the treatment of scalp psoriasis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this Phase 3b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (NCT03897088), patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis affecting the scalp (Investigator Global Assessment modified [IGA mod] 2011 [scalp] \u22653, Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index [PSSI] \u226512, \u226530% scalp surface area affected) received tildrakizumab 100 mg or placebo at W0 and W4.

We have developed a sinus rinse containing manuka honey, to identify whether it can help improve symptoms or reduce the bacterial load.\nMETHODS\n\n\nWe will undertake a randomised controlled trial where 30 adults with CF will be recruited and randomised to either the control or intervention group. Both groups will follow a sinus rinse protocol for 30 days (\u00b1 7 days); the control group will use the standard of care rinse, and the intervention group will use a manuka honey rinse. Both groups will provide samples at day 0 and day 30. The primary outcome measure will be a change in the 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) score.

It is widely accepted that clinical testing using surrogate markers including pulmonary function will be useful in assessing clinical efficacy.

An alternative to pulmonary testing of new CF treatments is use of the maxillary sinuses as a surrogate model of CF lung disease. Using CF sinusitis as a surrogate model for testing clinical efficacy of new treatments is attractive because CF upper respiratory disease is similar to the lower respiratory disease with respect to electrophysiology and microbiology.\nMETHODS\n\n\nSinusitis recurrence in untreated sinuses was analyzed during a prospective, randomized, unblinded, dose-escalation, within-subjects, phase I clinical trial of the adeno-associated virus mediated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (AAV-CFTR) gene transfer.\nRESULTS\n\n\nClinical symptoms combined with sinus endoscopy proved useful in the diagnosis of unilateral and bilateral sinusitis recurrence.

Women with a history of premenstrual symptoms (PMS) seem to respond differently to the addition of a progestin to estrogen than women without previous PMS. This study aimed to investigate personality traits and daily mood symptoms in women with a history of PMS and women without, while treated with estrogen and sequential progestin.\nMETHODS\n\n\nA total of 106 women, who participated in clinical trials designed to evaluate mood and physical responses to sequential estrogen and progestin therapy, filled out the Karolinska Personality Scale (KSP) form, before entering the studies. The treatment consisted of 2 mg estradiol valerate continuously, with an addition of 10 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) during the last 12 days of the 28-day cycle. Subjects kept daily symptom ratings using a validated symptom scale during these two treatment cycles, and these were used for the analyses. The study-groups were stratified for a history of PMS or not, appearance of progestin-induced adverse mood effects or not, and symptom cyclicity or not.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThere was a significant co-variation between the women who reported the highest negative mood scores during the addition of progestin to estrogen and a history of PMS. Women with PMS history reported different personality characteristics as having higher scores of anxiety symptoms of muscular tension, feeling more indirect aggression and lack of impulse control, and being less satisfied with their lives or childhood, compared to women without a PMS history. Women who reported the most intense negative mood symptoms during the progestin phase reported more somatic anxiety, an aim to avoid monotony, a lower satisfaction with life or childhood, and higher scores of indirect aggression and irritability.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nWomen with a history of PMS and women with a high anxiety-related personality might respond with adverse mood effects to a combination of estrogen and sequential progestin and therefore a thorough evaluation should be made, at the consultation for hormone therapy, of mood benefits or disadvantages before initiation of treatment and there should be a close follow-up after.","t2":"Pretreatment pattern of symptom expression in premenstrual dysphoric disorder.","p2":"The results of this analysis found significant within-patient variability in the time-to-onset and offset of PMDD symptoms, as well as their duration.","a2_doc":"BACKGROUND\n\n\nUse of intermittent dosing strategies for the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) highlights the need for detailed empirical data on the onset, duration and pattern of symptom expression in women suffering from PMDD.\nMETHOD\n\n\nData were analyzed from 276 women who met DSM-IV criteria for PMDD and prospectively charted two menstrual cycles prior to commencing sertraline treatment.

For this report, citalopram was used as the first treatment step. We also used data from the second step in which one of three new medications were used (bupropion-SR [sustained release], venlafaxine-XR [extended release], or sertraline). Treatment-blinded assessors obtained baseline treatment outcomes data. We hypothesized that those with reported premenstrual depressive symptom exacerbation would have more general medical conditions, longer index depressive episodes, lower response or remission rates, and shorter times-to-relapse with citalopram, and that they would have a better outcome with sertraline than with bupropion-SR.\nRESULTS\n\n\nAt baseline, 66% (n=545/821) of women reported premenstrual exacerbation. They had more general medical conditions, more anxious features, longer index episodes, and shorter times-to-relapse (41.3 to 47.1 weeks, respectively). Response and remission rates to citalopram, however, were unrelated to reported premenstrual exacerbation. Reported premenstrual exacerbation was also unrelated to differential benefit with sertraline and bupropion-SR.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nSelf-reported premenstrual exacerbation has moderate clinical utility in the management of depressed patients, although it is not predictive of overall treatment response.

CF-related bone disease (CFBD) is characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD) and fragility fractures. Estrogen deficiency increases bone resorption, resulting in decreased BMD that can be restored with estrogen replacement. Current CF guidelines recommend treating female hypogonadal patients with CFBD with estrogen replacement, but no prospective study has investigated the effects of estrogen supplementation on CFBD. Estrogen is known to modulate inflammatory markers and autoimmune diseases. We proposed to test the hypothesis that estrogen status plays a critical role in optimizing bone health, modulating inflammation, preserving lung function, and maximizing quality of life in premenopausal women with CF.\nMETHODS\n\n\nWe planned a randomized, placebo-controlled, investigator- and patient-blinded, pilot trial with two parallel arms. Eligible subjects were women with CF 18-50\u2009years old with hypogonadism and low BMD who were not taking systemic glucocorticoids, had not had a prior transplant, and did not have contraindications to oral estradiol. Subjects would be block randomized to receive oral estradiol or placebo for 6\u2009months. The primary outcome was feasibility metrics. Secondary outcomes included relative changes in estradiol, bone turnover markers, lung function, inflammatory markers, and quality of life metrics. The study was funded through departmental funds.\nRESULTS\n\n\nOf 233 subjects screened, 86 subjects were women with CF 18-50\u2009years old and none were eligible for participation. Most subjects were excluded due to absent DXA report (24%), normal BMD (22%), or use of systemic estrogen (16%). Due to difficulty recruiting the planned 52 subjects, the trial was closed for recruitment and no subjects were randomized.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThis study was designed to investigate the feasibility of a safety and efficacy trial of estrogen therapy for women with CF. Unfortunately, due to eligibility criteria, the study was unable to recruit subjects. This feasibility study highlights the need for improved BMD screening in young women with CF.

Initial evidence suggests cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) as an effective treatment for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). The aim of the current randomized clinical trial was to evaluate an Internet-based CBT (iCBT) to reduce the burden of PMDD.\nMETHODS\n\n\nIn all, 174 women with PMDD were recruited via newspaper articles, flyers, and social media. They were randomized to a treatment group (TG; n = 86) or waitlist control group (CG; n = 88). Women of the TG received an 8-week therapist-guided iCBT. Data were assessed before and after treatment/waiting, and 6 months after intervention with prospective symptom diaries and questionnaires in the premenstrual phase. Treatment effects and moderators were analysed using hierarchical linear modelling.\nRESULTS\n\n\nSignificant time \u00d7 group interaction effects on functional impairment and psychological impairment, impact on everyday life, symptom intensity, and symptom disability in favour of the TG indicated the efficacy of the treatment. Follow-up assessments demonstrated treatment effects to be stable until 6 months after treatment. Additionally, significant interactions with moderator variables were found. In the TG, higher levels of active coping and lower levels of support-seeking coping were associated with stronger improvement in interference in everyday life and symptom intensity. In addition, lower levels of perceived stress were associated with stronger improvement in functional impairment.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThe iCBT was highly effective in reducing the burden of PMDD.

Thus, symptoms could be precipitated either by an acute change in ovarian steroid levels or by stable levels above a critical threshold playing a permissive role in expression of an underlying infradian affective \"pacemaker.\" The authors attempted to determine which condition triggers PMDD symptoms.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThe study included 22 women with PMDD, ages 30 to 50 years. Twelve women who experienced symptom remission after 2-3 months of GnRH agonist-induced ovarian suppression (leuprolide) then received 1 month of single-blind (participant only) placebo and then 3 months of continuous combined estradiol/progesterone. Primary outcome measures were the Rating for Premenstrual Tension observer and self-ratings completed every 2 weeks during clinic visits. Multivariate repeated-measure ANOVA for mixed models was employed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBoth self- and observer-rated scores on the Rating for Premenstrual Tension were significantly increased (more symptomatic) during the first month of combined estradiol/progesterone compared with the last month of leuprolide alone, the placebo month, and the second and third months of estradiol/progesterone. There were no significant differences in symptom severity between the last month of leuprolide alone, placebo month, or second and third months of estradiol/progesterone. Finally, the Rating for Premenstrual Tension scores in the second and third estradiol/progesterone months did not significantly differ.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe findings demonstrate that the change in estradiol/progesterone levels from low to high, and not the steady-state level, was associated with onset of PMDD symptoms.

Treatment effects were also noted for the DRSP depressive symptom subscale (42% [SD=22] compared with 22% [SD=32]) and the DRSP anger/irritability subscale (47% [SD=21] compared with 23% [SD=35]), but not for the DRSP physical symptom subscale. Remission based on DRSP score was attained by 20 women in the UPA group (50.0%) and eight women in the placebo group (21.1%) (a statistically significant difference).\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nIf these results are replicated, UPA could be a useful treatment for PMDD, particularly for the psychological symptoms associated with the disorder.","subreddit_id":"t5_2r876","post_id":"ouweyz","stage2_labels":"[{\"crowd-entity-annotation\":{\"entities\":[{\"endOffset\":38,\"label\":\"intervention\",\"startOffset\":30},{\"endOffset\":56,\"label\":\"intervention\",\"startOffset\":52},{\"endOffset\":151,\"label\":\"outcome\",\"startOffset\":144},{\"endOffset\":281,\"label\":\"intervention\",\"startOffset\":268}]}}]","text":"Trikafta & PMDD\nSo, I believe trikafta has given me PMDD premenstrual dysphagia disorder.
