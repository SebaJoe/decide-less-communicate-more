The objectives of these post hoc analyses of the global Phase III 093-0304 trial (NCT00988429, Study 304) of adjunctive eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL) in patients with refractory focal (partial-onset) seizures (FS) were to evaluate associations between seizure severity change, measured by the Seizure Severity Questionnaire (SSQ), and 1) patient characteristics, 2) seizure frequency change, standardized as the seizure frequency (SSF) per 28-day period, and 3) change in HRQoL, evaluated by the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory-31 (QOLIE-31) and the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). The analyses were conducted on the per-protocol population (PPP) of patients who were randomized to a placebo arm (n\u202f=\u202f188) or an ESL-active group that included treatment with adjunctive ESL 800\u202fmg once daily (QD; n\u202f=\u202f184) or adjunctive ESL 1200\u202fmg QD (n\u202f=\u202f175). General linear models (GLM) were used to measure the association between SSQ change and patient baseline characteristics or percentage change in the SSF from baseline. Associations between changes in the SSQ and changes in the QOLIE-31 and MADRS were examined using GLM with patient baseline characteristics as covariates. Subgroup analyses were performed for patients in the ESL-active group and those treated with ESL 800\u202fmg or ESL 1200\u202fmg. Minimal clinically important difference (MCIDs) thresholds were used to assess improvements in SSQ scores. The analyses included 547 per-protocol patients. Patients using 1 antiepileptic drug (AED) at baseline had greater improvements in the SSQ compared with those receiving 2 AEDs (P\u202f=\u202f0.0606). Treatment with ESL 1200\u202fmg was significantly associated with clinically meaningful improvements in the SSQ (P\u202f=\u202f0.0005). The SSQ improvements were significantly associated with an SSF reduction of \u226575%, compared with no reduction (P\u202f<\u202f0.0001).

The vigabatrin and placebo groups were highly similar at entry into the study. At the end of the study, there were no differences between the vigabatrin and placebo groups on any cognitive variable or on any measure of mood and adjustment. Analysis of the results related to relief from seizures demonstrated only chance findings. In a similar manner, there were no relationships between vigabatrin serum levels at the end of the study and changes on measures of abilities and adjustment.

Noninferiority of TPM to PHT (primary objective) could not be established [hazard ratio (HR) 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.98 to 4.12, p = 0.366), and PHT could not be shown to be superior to TPM. A higher percentage discontinued with PHT compared to TPM for all reasons (21.1 vs. 12.8%) and due to adverse events (13.4 vs. 6.8%). The most common treatment-related adverse events in both groups were dizziness, paresthesia, and somnolence. A post hoc analysis showed that TPM was superior to PHT in time to discontinuation (retention rate) for all causes (89.4% vs. 80.3%, p = 0.047).\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThis study was inconclusive in establishing noninferiority of TPM 100 mg\/day compared to a standard regimen of oral PHT in seizure risk in this population of patients with new-onset epilepsy. Given the superiority of TPM in overall retention and favorable tolerability without titration, it may nonetheless be an appropriate option in some patients with new-onset epilepsy requiring rapid treatment initiation.","t7":"Carbamazepine markedly reduces serum concentrations of simvastatin and simvastatin acid.","p7":"The mean peak concentrations of both simvastatin and simvastatin acid were reduced by 68% ( P<0.01), and half-life of simvastatin acid was shortened from 5.9+\/-0.3 h to 3.7+\/-0.5 h ( P<0.01) by carbamazepine.\n","a7_doc":"OBJECTIVE\n\n\nThe aim of this study was to examine the effect of carbamazepine on the pharmacokinetics of orally administered simvastatin in healthy volunteers.\nMETHODS\n\n\nIn a randomised, two-phase crossover study and a wash out of 2 weeks, 12 healthy volunteers took carbamazepine for 14 days (600 mg daily except 200 mg daily for the first 2 days) or no drug.

The test battery comprised visual acuity, the Lanthony-D-15-d\u00e9satur\u00e9 colour perception test, increment, postadaptation and transient tritanopia threshold measurements, perception threshold assessment for monochromatic and chromatic gaussian dots, monochromatic gratings and gratings of differing spatial frequency, and critical flicker fusion tests with various stimuli. The only consistent and partly significant effects were seen after VGB and GBP. After VGB, increment, postadaptation and transient tritanopia thresholds and the critical flicker fusion increased, whereas GBP led to a somewhat converse profile. The other tests were not influenced consistently by any antiepileptic drug (AED). We conclude that: (i) gamma-amino-butyric acid-(GABA)-related properties as under the prototype drug VGB result in specific alterations of the transient tritanopia phenomenon which is consistent with the physiological hypothesis for this retinal paradigm based on extracellular recordings in primates. The possible mechanisms why VGB improved critical flicker fusion as the only AED in this trial are discussed. The profile of GBP indicates a unique mechanism of action. We have not observed specific influences on visual perception under AEDs which act mainly via alterations of ion membrane conductance. The transient tritanopia and flicker fusion paradigms we used appear to be promising to investigate antiepileptic drugs with hitherto unknown modes of actions in human noninvasively.","subreddit_id":"t5_2s1h9","post_id":"rjkrb9","stage2_labels":"[{\"crowd-entity-annotation\":{\"entities\":[{\"endOffset\":116,\"label\":\"intervention\",\"startOffset\":103},{\"endOffset\":138,\"label\":\"intervention\",\"startOffset\":124},{\"endOffset\":152,\"label\":\"intervention\",\"startOffset\":142}]}}]","text":"Grapefruit and siezures\nGuys, I am wondering if you have any issues or know about interactions between oxcarbazepine and\/or levetiracetam and grapefruit?

So we investigated the therapeutic effects of Biobran in patients with IBS. Method. Forty patients with diarrhea predominant or mixed type IBS were randomly assigned to either a Biobran group for treatment with Biobran or a placebo group. Therapeutic efficacy and IBS symptoms were assessed subjectively by the patients after 4 weeks of administration. Results. The global assessment was effective in 63.2% of the Biobran group and in 30% of the placebo group (P < 0.05, Biobran group versus placebo group).

This study was a randomized clinical trial on 64 IBS patients. The patients were selected according to Rome III criteria and were assigned into two groups. Bowel symptom severity and frequency scale and QOL-IBS were used to investigate the patients' symptoms. The first group underwent CBT with medication therapy, and the second group received only medication. Data were analyzed using analysis of multiple covariance. The two groups showed a significant difference in the QOL-IBS in posttreatment and follow-up stages ( P  < 0.05). There were significant differences in the severity and frequency of IBS symptoms between the two groups after the intervention ( P  < 0.05).

We investigated the effects of a diet low in FODMAPs compared with an Australian diet, in a randomized, controlled, single-blind, cross-over trial of patients with IBS.\nMETHODS\n\n\nIn a study of 30 patients with IBS and 8 healthy individuals (controls, matched for demographics and diet), we collected dietary data from subjects for 1 habitual week. Participants then randomly were assigned to groups that received 21 days of either a diet low in FODMAPs or a typical Australian diet, followed by a washout period of at least 21 days, before crossing over to the alternate diet. Daily symptoms were rated using a 0- to 100-mm visual analogue scale. Almost all food was provided during the interventional diet periods, with a goal of less than 0.5 g intake of FODMAPs per meal for the low-FODMAP diet. All stools were collected from days 17-21 and assessed for frequency, weight, water content, and King's Stool Chart rating.\nRESULTS\n\n\nSubjects with IBS had lower overall gastrointestinal symptom scores (22.8; 95% confidence interval, 16.7-28.8 mm) while on a diet low in FODMAPs, compared with the Australian diet (44.9; 95% confidence interval, 36.6-53.1 mm; P < .001) and the subjects' habitual diet. Bloating, pain, and passage of wind also were reduced while IBS patients were on the low-FODMAP diet. Symptoms were minimal and unaltered by either diet among controls. Patients of all IBS subtypes had greater satisfaction with stool consistency while on the low-FODMAP diet, but diarrhea-predominant IBS was the only subtype with altered fecal frequency and King's Stool Chart scores.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nIn a controlled, cross-over study of patients with IBS, a diet low in FODMAPs effectively reduced functional gastrointestinal symptoms. This high-quality evidence supports its use as a first-line therapy.\nCLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER\n\n\nACTRN12612001185853.","t9":"The short-term natural history of irritable bowel syndrome: a time-series analysis.","p9":"Many subjects' IBS severity was predictable over more than one day, and symptoms tended to occur in clusters rather than randomly.","a9_doc":"Although researchers have studied irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), including its physiological and psychological characteristics and treatments' effectiveness, basic descriptive information about IBS has been limited to lists of symptoms and explanations of what IBS is not.

Twenty-five subjects (17 females, 8 males), who were not receiving treatment for IBS, rated the severity of their IBS symptoms daily for 8 weeks. Four symptoms' (abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, constipation and diarrhea) ratings were slimmed to create a primary IBS symptom score. The data were detrended, then a time-series analysis was performed. Many subjects' IBS severity was predictable over more than one day, and symptoms tended to occur in clusters rather than randomly.

Patients who fulfilled the Rome III criteria for IBS with no alarm signals were randomly assigned to groups assessed by a strategy of exclusion (analyses of blood, stool samples for intestinal parasites, and sigmoidoscopies with biopsies) or a positive strategy (analyses of blood cell count and C-reactive protein). Patients were followed for 1 year. The primary end point was difference in change of HRQOL from baseline to 1 year between groups (on the basis of the Short Form 36 health survey, physical component summary, and noninferiority margin of 3 points). Secondary outcomes were change in gastrointestinal symptoms, satisfaction with management, and use of resources.

Sometimes they put a summary of those near the top, and sometimes you have to scroll to the end of the article. It's also a good idea to read the abstract\/summary at the top of the article so you have an idea of what the paper is about. Reading the other sections of the paper will give you more detail into what they did for the study, which will give more context, but isn't usually necessary to read the whole thing to understand the end results, which tell you what they found about the probiotics in relation to IBS.\n\nAnd of course, always talk to your doctor about medical stuff! I'm just providing this information in case it might be helpful. I am NOT giving medical advice or telling you all to take probiotics or endorsing any brands or types or anything. Whether you decide to take probiotics or not is up to you and your doctor. This is just an info dump in case anyone wanted to know this stuff.\n\nHere are the links:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.thelancet.com\/journals\/eclinm\/article\/PIIS2589-5370(21)00434-X\/fulltext\n\nhttps:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1590865819309594\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/labs\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7279071\/\n\nhttps:\/\/www.optibacprobiotics.com\/learning-lab\/in-depth\/gut-health\/which-probiotics-are-best-for-ibs#IBS-U\n\nhttps:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/fphar.2020.00332\/full#B68\n\nhttps:\/\/badgut.org\/information-centre\/a-z-digestive-topics\/probiotics-for-irritable-bowel-syndrome\/\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/labs\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3296087\/\n\nhttps:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/33745570\/\n\nhttps:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1111\/eci.13201","a1_anno":0,"a2_anno":0,"a3_anno":0,"a4_anno":0,"a5_anno":0,"a6_anno":0,"a7_anno":0,"a8_anno":0,"a9_anno":0,"a10_anno":0,"TS_PICOR":[{"Punchline":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1155\/2016\/4740907.].","Population":[],"Intervention":["Placebo","Multispecies Probiotic Supplementation"],"Outcome":["Alleviating Symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome"],"PubDate":"2019","Source":"Biomed Res Int"},{"Punchline":"A significantly greater improvement in the Symptom Severity Score of IBS and in scores for quality of life, days with pain and satisfaction with bowel habit was observed over the 8-week intervention period in the volunteers receiving the probiotic preparation than in the placebo group.\n","Population":["subjects with IBS","Fifty-two participants with IBS, as defined by the Rome II criteria"],"Intervention":["probiotic preparation comprising two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus CUL60 (NCIMB 30157) and CUL21 (NCIMB 30156), Bifidobacterium lactis CUL34 (NCIMB 30172) and Bifidobacterium bifidum CUL20 (NCIMB 30153) at a total of 2.5 \u00d7 10(10) cfu\/capsule or a placebo","LAB4, a multistrain probiotic preparation","placebo","probiotics","multistrain probiotic preparation","LAB4 multistrain probiotic supplement"],"Outcome":["symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome","IBS symptoms","Symptom Severity Score of IBS and in scores for quality of life, days with pain and satisfaction with bowel habit"],"PubDate":"2009 Jan","Source":"Aliment Pharmacol Ther"},{"Punchline":"With regards to all IBS symptoms an improvement was noted in 95% of patients in the LP299V group vs 15% of patients in the placebo group (P < 0.0001).\n","Population":["Forty patients","patients with IBS","patients with irritable bowel syndrome"],"Intervention":["LP299V in liquid suspension","placebo","Lactobacillus plantarum 299V (LP299V","LP299V","Lactobacillus plantarum 299V"],"Outcome":["normalization of stools frequency","resolution of their abdominal pain"],"PubDate":"2001 Oct","Source":"Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol"},{"Punchline":"There were no significant differences in mean gastrointestinal transit measurements, bowel function scores or satisfactory global symptom relief between the two treatment groups, pre- or post-therapy.","Population":["patients with Rome II irritable bowel syndrome with predominant diarrhoea","Twenty-five patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome","patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome","diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome"],"Intervention":["placebo","probiotic, VSL#3","probiotic formulation, VSL#3","VSL#3","VSL#3 powder (450 billion lyophilized bacteria\/day) or matching placebo"],"Outcome":["abdominal bloating","abdominal bloating scores","mean gastrointestinal transit measurements, bowel function scores or satisfactory global symptom relief","gastrointestinal transit and symptoms","individual symptoms: abdominal pain, gas and urgency","bowel function and symptoms daily"],"PubDate":"2003 Apr 1","Source":"Aliment Pharmacol Ther"},{"Punchline":"The global assessment was effective in 63.2% of the Biobran group and in 30% of the placebo group (P < 0.05, Biobran group versus placebo group).","Population":["IBS patients","patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS","patients with IBS","Forty patients with diarrhea predominant or mixed type IBS","diarrhea predominant or mixed type irritable bowel syndrome"],"Intervention":["Biobran, arabinoxylan compound derived from rice bran","Biobran group for treatment with Biobran or a placebo","placebo","biobran, modified arabinoxylan rice bran"],"Outcome":["Therapeutic efficacy and IBS symptoms","IBS symptoms","score of diarrhea and constipation and in CRP value"],"PubDate":"2014","Source":"Evid Based Complement Alternat Med"},{"Punchline":"Review of:  Aroniadis OC, Brandt LJ, Oneto C,  et al  Faecal microbiota transplantation for diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome: a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial.

Additionally, patient-, disorder- and treatment-related factors associated with adherence and persistence will be identified.\nMETHOD\n\n\nPost-hoc analysis of the active treatment group of a placebo-controlled, randomised, 24 week trial with MPH-ER with univariate description and multiple logistic regression models and Hosmer and Lemeshow tests.\nRESULTS\n\n\nIn the sample of 241 adults with ADHD (mean age of 35.2 \u00b1 10.1 years), 9.4% of the patients were non-adherent, taking less than 80% of the dispensed medication. Factors associated with non-adherence included age<25 years, education level lower than secondary education, lacking family history of ADHD, lower ADHD baseline severity and lower self- and observer-rated medication efficacy. Lacking family history of ADHD, lower education level and lower self-rated medication efficacy, predicted non-adherence with a prediction accuracy of 16%. Seventeen percent of the patients discontinued early with most discontinuing within the first five weeks of the MPH-ER titration phase. Mean persistence in the discontinuing group was 63.4 \u00b1 49.4 days. Factors associated with discontinuation included male gender, lower education level, lacking family history of ADHD and lower self- and observer-rated medication efficacy. Treatment non-response, male gender and lower education level predicted treatment discontinuation with a prediction accuracy of 22.7%.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nMale adults without relatives with ADHD, with lower educational level and lower self- and observer-rated medication efficacy, who are newly treated with MPH-ER, are at increased risk of non-adherence and treatment discontinuation. Patients are at increased risk of treatment discontinuation during the medication titration phase.","t2":"Stimulant medication withdrawal during long-term therapy in children with comorbid attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and chronic multiple tic disorder.","p2":"There was no change (group data) in the frequency or severity of motor tics or vocal tics during the placebo condition compared with maintenance dose of stimulant medication (ie, no evidence of tic exacerbation while receiving medication or of a withdrawal reaction).","a2_doc":"OBJECTIVES\n\n\nIn this study we examined changes in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder behaviors and motor and vocal tics during withdrawal from long-term maintenance therapy with stimulant medication.\nMETHODS\n\n\nSubjects were 19 children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and chronic tic disorder who had received methylphenidate (n = 17) or dextroamphetamine (n = 2) for a minimum of 1 year. Children were switched to placebo under double-blind conditions. Treatment effects were assessed by using direct observations of child behavior in a simulated (clinic-based) classroom and behavior rating scales completed by parents and clinician.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThere was no change (group data) in the frequency or severity of motor tics or vocal tics during the placebo condition compared with maintenance dose of stimulant medication (ie, no evidence of tic exacerbation while receiving medication or of a withdrawal reaction). There was no evidence of tic exacerbation in the evening as a rebound effect. Treatment with the maintenance dose was also associated with behavioral improvement in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder behaviors, indicating continued efficacy.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nAbrupt withdrawal of stimulant medication in children receiving long-term maintenance therapy does not appear to result in worsening of tic frequency or severity. Nevertheless, these findings do not preclude the possibility of drug withdrawal reactions in susceptible individuals.","t3":"Baseline characteristics of European and non-European adult patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder participating in a placebo-controlled, randomized treatment study with atomoxetine.","p3":"The adult ADHD Quality of Life-Life Outlook and Life Productivity domain scores were significantly different between groups (p\u2264.0004).","a3_doc":"BACKGROUND\n\n\nAttention deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often presents as an impairing lifelong condition in adults; yet it is currently underdiagnosed and undertreated in many European countries.

This investigation may bear special importance for an adolescent (as opposed to child) population, because hormonal and metabolism differences between sexes are most likely to emerge at this time. Male (n = 19) and female (n = 16) adolescents, ages 16-19 with ADHD, participated in a randomized, double-blind crossover study evaluating the effectiveness of osmotic-release methylphenidate, extended release amphetamine salts, placebo, and routine limited medication regimen. Medication efficacy was evaluated using ADHD symptom ratings from adolescent self-report and parent report, along with objective measures of inattention and hyperactivity\/impulsivity during driving performance and neuropsychological tasks. Males and females were largely equivalent in impairment, and medication was similarly effective in reducing symptoms. No interactions were found between sex and medication on any measure of effectiveness or side effects. This finding suggests that the efficacy and tolerability of extended-release stimulant medications is equivalent for male and female adolescents with ADHD.","t5":"Children with ADHD and motor dysfunction compared with children with ADHD only.","p5":"Both groups of children had a linear dose response to medication (placebo, low, high) and there was no evidence of a group by dose interaction or an overall group effect at home or school.","a5_doc":"The purpose of this study was to identify group differences in children with attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder and motor dysfunction (ADHD-MD) and ADHD only, and to evaluate the medication responsiveness of ADHD-MD.

Forty-nine trials were completed. Nineteen were children with ADHD-MD, 44 had ADHD only. Behavior and functioning were assessed at home and at school. Treatment effects were assessed using the Abbreviated Symptom Questionnaire for Parents and Teachers. Children with ADHD-MD were more likely to have severe ADHD-combined type and other neurodevelopmental and behavioral problems. Both groups of children had a linear dose response to medication (placebo, low, high) and there was no evidence of a group by dose interaction or an overall group effect at home or school.

The principal outcome measures were the Revised Conners' Parent and Teacher Rating Scales.\nRESULTS\n\n\nFifty-three families (73%) returned the follow-up surveys. At 6-9 months, mean T scores were still significantly lower than the mean at baseline for all factors of both the CPRS-R and CTRS-R (P < 0.01). There were no statistically significant differences between scores at 6-9 months and scores at the completion of the corresponding medication period in the crossover trial.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nAfter 6-9 months treatment with stimulant medication, ratings remained significantly better than at baseline.

As nonstimulant treatments are often used after stimulants in ADHD, GXR was assessed relative to prior stimulant treatment in a randomized controlled trial (RCT), in which ATX was included as a reference arm, and in the open-label phase of a randomized-withdrawal study (RWS). Participants were 6-17 years old with ADHD Rating Scale version IV (ADHD-RS-IV) scores \u226532 and Clinical Global Impressions - Severity scores \u22654. RCT participants received dose-optimized GXR (1-7 mg\/day), ATX (10-100 mg\/day), or placebo for 10-13 weeks. RWS participants received dose-optimized GXR (1-7 mg\/day) for 13 weeks. Participants' last stimulant medication prior to enrolment, and reasons for stopping this medication, were collected at baseline. Change from baseline ADHD-RS-IV score and the proportion of responders were assessed by prior stimulant exposure. Of 163 RCT and 296 RWS participants who had previously received stimulant treatment, 142 and 224, respectively, had received methylphenidate (MPH); due to the low number of participants and the heterogeneity of non-MPH treatments, we only report data for prior MPH treatment. The most frequent reasons for stopping MPH were lack of effectiveness or side effects. Placebo-adjusted ADHD-RS-IV changes from baseline were significant in participants receiving GXR (prior MPH, -9.8, P<0.001, effect size [ES] 0.85; stimulant-na\u00efve, -7.6, P<0.001, ES 0.65). In ATX-treated participants, significant placebo-adjusted differences were seen in stimulant-na\u00efve (-5.0, P=0.022, ES 0.43) but not prior MPH-treated (-1.8, P>0.05, ES 0.15) participants. More participants met responder criteria with GXR versus placebo, regardless of prior treatment. GXR response was unaffected by prior stimulant treatment; ATX produced improvement only in stimulant-na\u00efve participants relative to placebo. These findings may be relevant to clinical decision-making regarding sequencing of ADHD treatments.","t8":"Efficacy of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate for promoting occupational success in adolescents and young adults with attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder.","p8":"Ratings of job application quality, job interview performance, and delivery outcomes were not significantly different on medication versus placebo.","a8_doc":"There has been a lack of research on the third area of impairment noted in the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition -\"occupational functioning.\" It is important to understand the impact of common treatments for attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in occupational settings.

Outcome measures included ratings of performance, as well as behavioral productivity. Results indicated that participants completed more workplace tasks when on medication, relative to placebo. Ratings of job application quality, job interview performance, and delivery outcomes were not significantly different on medication versus placebo. These results suggest positive effects of medication in a workplace environment, but also a need for study of additional interventions to support workplace-related behavior and functioning.
