Testing at baseline and after 12 weeks of vigabatrin (n = 83) or placebo (n = 85) used eight measures of cognitive abilities and three of mood and adjustment. The vigabatrin and placebo groups were highly similar at entry into the study. At the end of the study, there were no differences between the vigabatrin and placebo groups on any cognitive variable or on any measure of mood and adjustment. Analysis of the results related to relief from seizures demonstrated only chance findings. In a similar manner, there were no relationships between vigabatrin serum levels at the end of the study and changes on measures of abilities and adjustment. Vigabatrin appears to be a useful antiepilepsy drug with little impact upon tests of either cognitive abilities or quality of life.","t2":"Bioavailability of two carbamazepine preparations during chronic administration to epileptic patients.","p2":"There was no difference in absorption or steady-state level between the two preparations.","a2_doc":"Two preparations of carbamazepine, as tablets and in syrup, were given for 8 weeks to 20 patients with epilepsy in a randomized crossover study.

Carbamazepine 10, 11-oxide was constantly present when the level of carbamazepine was over 5 mg/l, and tended to be lower with the syrup.","t3":"Associations between seizure severity change and patient characteristics, changes in seizure frequency, and health-related quality of life in patients with focal seizures treated with adjunctive eslicarbazepine acetate: Post hoc analyses of clinical trial results.","p3":"There was no significant association between changes in the SSQ and changes in the MADRS in patients treated with ESL.","a3_doc":"The relationships between seizure severity change and patient characteristics, changes in seizure frequency, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) may be important for determining the overall impact of medication therapy on patients with epilepsy. The objectives of these post hoc analyses of the global Phase III 093-0304 trial (NCT00988429, Study 304) of adjunctive eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL) in patients with refractory focal (partial-onset) seizures (FS) were to evaluate associations between seizure severity change, measured by the Seizure Severity Questionnaire (SSQ), and 1) patient characteristics, 2) seizure frequency change, standardized as the seizure frequency (SSF) per 28-day period, and 3) change in HRQoL, evaluated by the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory-31 (QOLIE-31) and the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). The analyses were conducted on the per-protocol population (PPP) of patients who were randomized to a placebo arm (n\u202f=\u202f188) or an ESL-active group that included treatment with adjunctive ESL 800\u202fmg once daily (QD; n\u202f=\u202f184) or adjunctive ESL 1200\u202fmg QD (n\u202f=\u202f175). General linear models (GLM) were used to measure the association between SSQ change and patient baseline characteristics or percentage change in the SSF from baseline. Associations between changes in the SSQ and changes in the QOLIE-31 and MADRS were examined using GLM with patient baseline characteristics as covariates. Subgroup analyses were performed for patients in the ESL-active group and those treated with ESL 800\u202fmg or ESL 1200\u202fmg. Minimal clinically important difference (MCIDs) thresholds were used to assess improvements in SSQ scores. The analyses included 547 per-protocol patients. Patients using 1 antiepileptic drug (AED) at baseline had greater improvements in the SSQ compared with those receiving 2 AEDs (P\u202f=\u202f0.0606). Treatment with ESL 1200\u202fmg was significantly associated with clinically meaningful improvements in the SSQ (P\u202f=\u202f0.0005). The SSQ improvements were significantly associated with an SSF reduction of \u226575%, compared with no reduction (P\u202f<\u202f0.0001). In the PPP and the ESL-active group, SSQ improvements were significantly associated with improvements in QOLIE-31 Total Score (TS; P\u202f<\u202f0.0001) and the Seizure Worry (SW; P\u202f<\u202f0.0001) and Social Functioning (SF; P\u202f=\u202f0.0030) subscales. In the ESL 1200\u202fmg subgroup, SSQ improvements were significantly associated with improvements in QOLIE-31 TS (P\u202f<\u202f0.0001) and the SW (P\u202f<\u202f0.0001) and Energy/Fatigue (EF; P\u202f=\u202f0.0007) subscales. In the ESL 800\u202fmg subgroup, improvements in the SSQ were significantly associated with improvements in QOLIE-31 TS (P\u202f=\u202f0.0362) and the SW (P\u202f=\u202f0.0241) subscale. There was no significant association between changes in the SSQ and changes in the MADRS in patients treated with ESL. These findings demonstrated that in this clinical trial population, adding ESL to baseline AED therapy had utility for decreasing seizure severity and improving HRQoL. There were no significant associations between changes in seizure severity and changes in depressive symptoms in patients with FS.","t4":"Therapeutic bioequivalency study of brand name versus generic carbamazepine.","p4":"Average seizure frequencies were statistically the same (at a 20% difference, p less than 0.05).","a4_doc":"We performed a randomized double-blind crossover therapeutic bioequivalency study of a generic (Epitol) versus a brand name (Tegretol) carbamazepine product under steady-state conditions in 40 epileptic patients.

Group A consisted of 20 seizure-free (from 5 months to 2 years) patients and group B of 20 patients with seizures refractory to drug therapy. In group A, four patients had seizures, two on both Epitol and Tegretol and two on Tegretol. In group B, the average seizure frequencies were 0.25 seizures per day on Epitol and 0.22 seizures per day on Tegretol.

After an 8-week baseline period, patients were randomized 2:1 to ganaxolone 1,500\u00a0mg/day or placebo for a 10-week treatment period (2-week forced titration and 8-week maintenance) followed by either tapering or entry into an open-label extension study. The primary endpoint was mean weekly seizure frequency. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients experiencing \u226550% reduction in seizure frequency (responder rate), percent change in mean weekly seizure frequency, seizure-free days, and quality of life. Safety and tolerability assessments included adverse events (AEs), treatment discontinuation, and clinical laboratory evaluations. Efficacy analyses were performed on the intent-to-treat population.\nRESULTS\n\n\nOf 147 randomized patients (98 ganaxolone, 49 placebo), 131 completed the study; 95% of participants titrated up to 1,500\u00a0mg/day and 78% maintained this dose.

The primary end point was time to seizure, and the primary objective was to establish noninferiority of TPM to PHT in the risk of seizure.\nRESULTS\n\n\nAt day 28, the estimated seizure-free rate was 81.1% for TPM treatment in comparison with 90.3% for PHT treatment. Noninferiority of TPM to PHT (primary objective) could not be established [hazard ratio (HR) 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.98 to 4.12, p = 0.366), and PHT could not be shown to be superior to TPM. A higher percentage discontinued with PHT compared to TPM for all reasons (21.1 vs. 12.8%) and due to adverse events (13.4 vs. 6.8%). The most common treatment-related adverse events in both groups were dizziness, paresthesia, and somnolence. A post hoc analysis showed that TPM was superior to PHT in time to discontinuation (retention rate) for all causes (89.4% vs. 80.3%, p = 0.047).\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThis study was inconclusive in establishing noninferiority of TPM 100 mg/day compared to a standard regimen of oral PHT in seizure risk in this population of patients with new-onset epilepsy. Given the superiority of TPM in overall retention and favorable tolerability without titration, it may nonetheless be an appropriate option in some patients with new-onset epilepsy requiring rapid treatment initiation.","t7":"Comparative bioavailability of carbamazepine from two slow-release preparations.","p7":"There were more epileptic seizures on Tegretol Retard than on Neurotol slow, but the difference was not statistically significant.","a7_doc":"In order to compare the multiple-dose bioavailability of carbamazepine (CBZ) from 2 slow-release preparations, Neurotol slow and Tegretol Retard, a single-blind, randomized, cross-over study was carried out. 21 adult patients with epilepsy were enrolled in the study. At the end of both 2-week treatment periods, a blood sample series was drawn after the administration of the morning CBZ dose. The serum concentrations of CBZ, CBZ-10,11-epoxide (CBZE) and 10,11-dihydro-10,11-trans-dihydroxy-CBZ (CBZD) were measured using HPLC. The mean bioavailability of CBZ from Neurotol slow was 11% (P = 0.002) higher than from Tegretol Retard. Owing to the better bioavailability, the peak (Cmax), lowest (Cmin) and mean (Css) concentrations of CBZ were also significantly higher during Neurotol slow treatment. Fluctuation of serum CBZ concentrations (Cmax-Cmin/Css, ADCss/AUC0-12h) did not differ significantly between the 2 treatments; neither did tmax. Similar results were obtained with CBZE and CBZD. There were more epileptic seizures on Tegretol Retard than on Neurotol slow, but the difference was not statistically significant. We conclude that there are significant differences in the bioavailability of CBZ from these 2 slow-release preparations.","t8":"Efficacy and tolerability of adjunctive brivaracetam in adults with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures: a phase IIb, randomized, controlled trial.","p8":"During the treatment period, this was 34.9% for BRV50 (p = 0.004) and 28.3% for BRV150 (p = 0.070) compared with 16.3% for placebo.","a8_doc":"PURPOSE\n\n\nTo evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of adjunctive brivaracetam (BRV), a novel high-affinity synaptic vesicle protein 2A ligand that also displays inhibitory activity at neuronal voltage-dependent sodium channels, in adult epilepsy patients with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures.\nMETHODS\n\n\nA phase IIb, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging study (N01114; NCT00175929) was conducted in patients aged 16-65 years. To be included in the study, patients were required to have experienced four or more partial-onset seizures during a 4-week prospective baseline, despite treatment with 1-2 concomitant antiepileptic drugs. Patients were randomized in a ratio of 1:1:1 to receive BRV 50 mg/day (BRV50), 150 mg/day (BRV150), or placebo. A 3-week up-titration period was followed by a 7-week maintenance period (total treatment period of 10 weeks).\nKEY FINDINGS\n\n\nA total of 157 patients were randomized (intent-to-treat [ITT] population; BRV50 n = 53, BRV150 n = 52, placebo n = 52) and overall 148 (94.3%) completed the study.

However, during the entire 10-week treatment period a statistically significant difference was observed for both BRV groups (17.7% for BRV50 [p = 0.026] and 16.3% for BRV150 [p = 0.043]). The median percent reduction from baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency/week during the maintenance period was 38.2% for BRV50 (p = 0.017) and 30.0% for BRV150 (p = 0.113) versus 18.9% in the placebo group. During the treatment period, this was 34.9% for BRV50 (p = 0.004) and 28.3% for BRV150 (p = 0.070) compared with 16.3% for placebo. Fifty percent responder rates during the maintenance period were 23.1% for placebo compared with 39.6% for BRV50 (odds ratio [OR] 2.17, p = 0.077) and 33.3% for BRV150 (OR 1.66, p = 0.261). During the treatment period, 50% responder rates were 17.3% for placebo compared with 35.8% for BRV50 (OR 2.69, p = 0.038) and 30.8% for BRV150 (OR 2.15, p = 0.114). Nine patients were free from partial-onset seizures during the 10-week treatment period (five patients [9.4%] in the BRV50 group and three [5.8%] in the BRV150 group compared with one patient [1.9%] in the placebo group). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported during the treatment period were mostly mild-to-moderate with similar incidence across treatment groups (BRV50 36/53, 67.9%; BRV150 35/52, 67.3%; placebo 37/52, 71.2%). The most frequently reported TEAEs in BRV groups were headache, fatigue, nasopharyngitis, nausea, somnolence, and dizziness, although nausea had a higher incidence in the placebo group.\nSIGNIFICANCE\n\n\nIn this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase IIb study of adjunctive BRV (50 and 150 mg/day) in adults with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures, the primary efficacy analysis did not reach statistical significance; however, statistically significant differences compared with placebo were observed on several secondary efficacy outcomes. BRV was well tolerated.","t9":"The influence of established and new antiepileptic drugs on visual perception. 1. A placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-dose study in healthy volunteers.","p9":"After VGB, increment, postadaptation and transient tritanopia thresholds and the critical flicker fusion increased, whereas GBP led to a somewhat converse profile.","a9_doc":"The influence of single oral dosages of carbamazepine (CBZ), valproic acid, vigabatrin (VGB), lamotrigine (LTG), gabapentin (GBP), and losigamone (LSG) on visual perception was investigated in ten healthy volunteers according to a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study design. The test battery comprised visual acuity, the Lanthony-D-15-d\u00e9satur\u00e9 colour perception test, increment, postadaptation and transient tritanopia threshold measurements, perception threshold assessment for monochromatic and chromatic gaussian dots, monochromatic gratings and gratings of differing spatial frequency, and critical flicker fusion tests with various stimuli. The only consistent and partly significant effects were seen after VGB and GBP. After VGB, increment, postadaptation and transient tritanopia thresholds and the critical flicker fusion increased, whereas GBP led to a somewhat converse profile. The other tests were not influenced consistently by any antiepileptic drug (AED). We conclude that: (i) gamma-amino-butyric acid-(GABA)-related properties as under the prototype drug VGB result in specific alterations of the transient tritanopia phenomenon which is consistent with the physiological hypothesis for this retinal paradigm based on extracellular recordings in primates. The possible mechanisms why VGB improved critical flicker fusion as the only AED in this trial are discussed. The profile of GBP indicates a unique mechanism of action. We have not observed specific influences on visual perception under AEDs which act mainly via alterations of ion membrane conductance. The transient tritanopia and flicker fusion paradigms we used appear to be promising to investigate antiepileptic drugs with hitherto unknown modes of actions in human noninvasively.","t10":"Long-term effects of adjunctive perampanel on cognition in adolescents with partial seizures.","p10":"Perampanel had no effect on the CDR system global cognition score, continuity of attention, quality of episodic memory, quality of working memory, or speed of memory but was associated with a significant decline in power of attention at end of treatment compared with baseline (p=0.03).","a10_doc":"OBJECTIVE\n\n\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate long-term effects of adjunctive perampanel on cognition, efficacy, growth, safety, and tolerability in adolescents with inadequately controlled partial seizures.\nMETHODS\n\n\nStudy 235, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, Phase II study with an open-label extension phase (NCT01161524), was primarily designed to assess the effects of adjunctive perampanel on cognition. Patients (aged \u226512 to <18years) had a diagnosis of epilepsy with inadequately controlled partial seizures, with or without secondary generalization, despite receiving 1-3 antiepileptic drugs. During the double-blind phase, adjunctive perampanel or placebo was administered over a 6-week titration period and a 13-week maintenance period up to 12mg/day. During the extension phase, all patients received perampanel. Data from the extension phase are presented here. Study endpoints included change from baseline in Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) measures of cognition, seizure frequency, growth, development, the occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and laboratory values.\nRESULTS\n\n\nA total of 114 patients entered the extension phase (prior double-blind treatment: placebo, n=41; perampanel, n=73). Perampanel had no effect on the CDR system global cognition score, continuity of attention, quality of episodic memory, quality of working memory, or speed of memory but was associated with a significant decline in power of attention at end of treatment compared with baseline (p=0.03). There were no effects on language skills or manual dexterity from baseline to end of treatment. At Weeks 40-52, median reduction in seizure frequency was 74.1%, and 50% responder rate was 66.0%. There were no clinically relevant effects of perampanel on growth or development at end of treatment compared with baseline. Overall, 84.2% of patients experienced at least one TEAE and 70.2% experienced at least one treatment-related TEAE. The most common TEAEs were dizziness (29.8%) and somnolence (19.3%). The TEAEs resulted in the discontinuation of treatment in 6.1% of patients.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nIn keeping with the 19-week double-blind phase, long-term adjunctive treatment with perampanel did not have any significant overall effects on the CDR system global cognition score in adolescent patients with inadequately controlled partial seizures. Similar trends were observed across the individual CDR system domains. Adjunctive perampanel showed sustained long-term seizure control and had a safety and tolerability profile similar to that observed in prior clinical studies.","subreddit_id":"t5_2s1h9","post_id":"rjkrb9","stage2_labels":"[{\"crowd-entity-annotation\":{\"entities\":[{\"endOffset\":116,\"label\":\"intervention\",\"startOffset\":103},{\"endOffset\":138,\"label\":\"intervention\",\"startOffset\":124},{\"endOffset\":152,\"label\":\"intervention\",\"startOffset\":142}]}}]","text":"Grapefruit and siezures\nGuys, I am wondering if you have any issues or know about interactions between oxcarbazepine and/or levetiracetam and grapefruit?

Ivermectin has been recommended widely as a treatment of COVID-19, but whether it has clinically significant antiviral activity in vivo is uncertain.\nMethods\n\n\nIn a multicentre open label, randomized, controlled adaptive platform trial, adult patients with early symptomatic COVID-19 were randomized to one of six treatment arms including high-dose oral ivermectin (600 \u00b5g/kg daily for 7 days), the monoclonal antibodies casirivimab and imdevimab (600 mg/600 mg), and no study drug. The primary outcome was the comparison of viral clearance rates in the modified intention-to-treat population.

Here, we aimed to assess the immunogenicity and safety of a booster dose of an inactivated whole-virus COVID-19 vaccine (VLA2001) after primary vaccination with 2 doses of either VLA2001 or ChAdOx1-S (Oxford-Astra Zeneca), including the cross-neutralization capacity against the Delta and Omicron VoCs.\nMETHODS\n\n\nThis interim analysis of an open-label extension of a randomized, controlled phase 3 trial assessed a single booster dose of an inactivated whole-virus COVID-19 vaccine (VLA2001) in healthy or medically stable adults aged 18 years and above, recruited in 21 clinical sites in the UK, who had previously received two doses of either VLA2001 or ChAdOx1-S. Safety outcomes were frequency and severity of solicited injection site and systemic reactions within 7 days after booster vaccination as well as frequency and severity of any unsolicited adverse events (AE) after up to 6 months. Immunogenicity outcomes were the immune response to ancestral SARS-CoV-2 assessed 14 days post booster expressed as geometric mean titres (GMT), GMT fold ratios and seroconversion of specific neutralizing antibodies and S-protein binding IgG antibodies. Immunogenicity against the Delta and Omicron VoCs was assessed as a post-hoc outcome with a pseudovirus neutralization antibody assay. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04864561, and is ongoing.\nRESULTS\n\n\nA booster dose of VLA2001 was administered to 958 participants, of whom 712 had been primed with VLA2001, and 246 with ChAdOx1-S. Within 7 days following these booster doses, 607 (63.4%) participants reported solicited injection site reactions, and 487 (50.8%) reported solicited systemic reactions. Up to 14 days post booster, 751 (78.4%) participants reported at least one adverse event. The tolerability profile of a booster dose of VLA2001 was similar in VLA2001-primed and ChAdOx1-S-primed participants. In VLA2001-primed participants, the GMT (95% CI) of neutralizing antibodies increased from 32.5 (22.8, 46.3) immediately before to 521.5 (413.0, 658.6) 2 weeks after administration of the booster dose, this corresponds to a geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) of 27.7 (20.0, 38.5). Compared to 2 weeks after the second priming dose, the GMFR was 3.6 (2.8, 4.7). In the ChAdOx1-S primed group, the GMT (95% CI) of neutralizing antibodies increased from 65.8 (43.9, 98.4) immediately before to 188.3 (140.3, 252.8) 2 weeks after administration of the booster dose, a geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) of 3.0 (2.2, 4.0). Compared to 2 weeks after the second priming dose, the GMFR was 1.6 (1.1, 2.2). For S-protein binding IgG antibodies, the pre- versus post-booster GMT fold ratio (95% CI) was 34.6 (25.0, 48.0) in the VLA2001-primed group and 4.0 (3.0, 5.2) in the ChAdOx1-S-primed group. Compared to 2 weeks after the second priming dose, the GMT fold rise of IgG antibodies was 3.8 (3.2, 4.6) in the VLA2001-primed group and 1.2 (0.9, 1.6) in the ChAdOx1-S-primed group. The GMT against Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (BA.4/5) increased from 4.2 to 260, and from 2.7 to 56.7, respectively, when boosting subjects previously primed with VLA2001. Following the boost, 97% of subjects primed with VLA2001 had detectable Delta- and 94% Omicron-neutralizing antibodies. In subjects primed with ChAdOx1-S, the GMT against Delta and Omicron titres increased from 9.1 to 92.5, and from 3.6 to 12.3, respectively. After boosting, 99% of subjects primed with ChAdOx1-S had detectable Delta- and 70% Omicron-neutralizing antibodies. In both VLA2001 and ChAdOx1-S primed subjects, the additional VLA2001 dose boosted T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 antigens to levels above those observed before the booster dose.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nA booster dose of VLA2001 was safe and well tolerated after primary immunization with VLA2001 and ChAdOx1-S. The tolerability of a booster dose of VLA2001 was similar to the favourable profile observed after the first and second priming doses. Both in a homologous and a heterologous setting, boosting resulted in higher neutralizing antibody titres than after primary immunization and significant increases in cross-neutralization titres against Delta and Omicron were observed after the booster dose. These data support the use of VLA2001 in booster programmes in ChadOx1-S primed groups.","t4":"Efficacy of interferon beta-1a plus remdesivir compared with remdesivir alone in hospitalised adults with COVID-19: a double-bind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial.","p4":"The Kaplan-Meier estimate of mortality at 28 days was 5% (95% CI 3-7%) in the interferon beta-1a plus remdesivir group and 3% (2-6%) in the placebo plus remdesivir group (hazard ratio 1\u00b733","a4_doc":"BACKGROUND\n\n\nFunctional impairment of interferon, a natural antiviral component of the immune system, is associated with the pathogenesis and severity of COVID-19.

There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of mortality rate (P-value\u00a0=\u00a00.8) and the need for mechanical ventilation (P-value\u00a0=\u00a00.39). The length of hospital stay was significantly lower for the control group than that of the intervention group (P-value\u00a0=\u00a00.003). There was a significant positive relationship between the time from hospital admission to IVIg initiation and the length of stay in the hospital and ICU among the survivors (P-value\u00a0<\u00a00.001 and\u00a0=0.01, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nOur findings did not support the use of IVIg in combination with hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir in treatment of severe COVID-19 cases.","t7":"A Phase 2 Randomized Trial Evaluating the Antiviral Activity and Safety of the Direct-Acting Antiviral Bemnifosbuvir in Ambulatory Patients with Mild or Moderate COVID-19 (MOONSONG Study).","p7":"the difference in viral RNA adjusted means at day 7 was -0.25","a7_doc":"Bemnifosbuvir is an oral antiviral drug with a dual mechanism of action targeting viral RNA polymerase, with  in vitro  activity against SARS-CoV-2. We conducted a phase 2, double-blind study evaluating the antiviral activity, safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of bemnifosbuvir in ambulatory patients with mild/moderate COVID-19. Patients were randomized 1:1 to bemnifosbuvir 550\u2009mg or placebo (cohort A) and 3:1 to bemnifosbuvir 1,100\u2009mg or placebo (cohort B); all doses were given twice daily for 5\u2009days. The primary endpoint was a change from baseline in the amount of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). The modified intent-to-treat infected population comprised 100 patients (bemnifosbuvir 550\u2009mg,  n\u2009 =\u200930; bemnifosbuvir 1,100\u2009mg,  n\u2009 =\u200930; cohort A placebo,  n\u2009 =\u200930; cohort B placebo,  n\u2009 =\u200910). The primary endpoint was not met: the difference in viral RNA adjusted means at day 7 was -0.25 log 10  copies/mL between bemnifosbuvir 550\u2009mg and cohort A placebo (80% confidence interval [CI], -0.66 to 0.16;  P \u2009=\u20090.4260), and -0.08 log 10  copies/mL between bemnifosbuvir 1,100\u2009mg and pooled placebo (80% CI, -0.48 to 0.33;  P \u2009=\u20090.8083). Bemnifosbuvir 550\u2009mg was well tolerated. Incidence of nausea and vomiting was higher with bemnifosbuvir 1,100\u2009mg (10.0% and 16.7% of patients, respectively) than pooled placebo (2.5% nausea, 2.5% vomiting). In the primary analysis, bemnifosbuvir did not show meaningful antiviral activity on nasopharyngeal viral load as measured by RT-PCR compared with placebo in patients with mild/moderate COVID-19. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration number NCT04709835.  IMPORTANCE  COVID-19 continues to be a major global public health challenge, and there remains a need for effective and convenient direct-acting antivirals that can be administered outside health care settings. Bemnifosbuvir is an oral antiviral with a dual mechanism of action and potent  in vitro  activity against SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we evaluated the antiviral activity, safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of bemnifosbuvir in ambulatory patients with mild/moderate COVID-19. In the primary analysis, bemnifosbuvir did not show meaningful antiviral activity compared with placebo as assessed by nasopharyngeal viral loads. The negative predictive value of nasopharyngeal viral load reduction for clinical outcomes in COVID-19 is currently unclear, and further evaluation of bemnifosbuvir for COVID-19 may be warranted despite the findings observed in this study.","t8":"Clinical Consequences for Individuals Treated with Tocilizumab for Serious COVID-19 Infection.","p8":"In hospitalized patients with severe illness and COVID-19, tocilizumab was ineffective in preventing intubation or death.","a8_doc":"There seem to currently be no therapeutic medications found for the severe coronavirus infection in 2019 (COVID-19). In light of this, it has been hypothesized that the immunomodulatory treatment known as tocilizumab can lessen the inflammatory response that occurs in the respiratory system, speed up the process of clinical benefit, lower the risk of death, and avert the need for ventilators. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) studied patients with a proven infection of SARS-CoV-2 and hyperinflammatory reactions. The inclusion criteria included fever (body temperature > 38 \u00b0C), pulmonary infiltrates, or supplemental oxygen. The patients received either conventional treatment with one dose of either tocilizumab (8 mg per kilogram of body weight) or conventional treatment only. The subjects were randomized to receive either treatment with a 1:1 ratio. A time-to-event test was conducted to determine the time to intubation or death. There was an insignificant difference between the investigated groups regarding the time to death, time to mechanical ventilation, and percentage of deaths. The conventional group's median (IQR) hospital length of stay was 4 (3-6) days, whereas the tocilizumab therapy group was 7 (4.75-10) days. There was a substantial difference in the mechanical ventilation rates in both groups, which were 17 (34%) and 28 (56%), respectively. In hospitalized patients with severe illness and COVID-19, tocilizumab was ineffective in preventing intubation or death.

COVID-19-related ARDS is subject to a mortality rate of 50% and prolonged period of mechanical ventilation, with no specific pharmacological treatment currently available (Infection au nouveau Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), COVID-19, France et Monde. https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/dossiers/coronavirus-covid-19 ). Because of its immunomodulatory action, we propose to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) administration in patients developing COVID-19-related ARDS.\nMETHODS\n\n\nThe trial is a phase III double-blind, randomized, multicenter, parallel group, concurrent, controlled study in hospitalized participants with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation using a sequential design. Participants in the treatment group will receive infusions of polyvalent immunoglobulin for 4 consecutive days, and the placebo group will receive an equivalent volume of sodium chloride 0.9% for the same duration. The primary outcome is the number of ventilator-free days up to the 28th day. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of IVIG on (1) organ failure according to the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at 14 and 28\u2009days, (2) lung injury score at 14 and 28\u2009days, (3) the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 adverse events of IVIG, (4) length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, (5) length of hospital stay, (6) functional outcomes at day 90 defined by the activities of daily living and instrumental activities of the daily living scales, and (7) 90-day survival. One hundred thirty-eight subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to IVIG or placebo groups (69 in each group), considering 90% power, alpha level 0.05 (two sides), and 0.67 effect size level.\nDISCUSSION\n\n\nThe ICAR trial investigates the effect of IVIG in COVID-19-related ARDS.

Patients were seen on post-operative day 6, and completed a visual analogue score reporting the post-operative discomfort from nasal packing on each side. Following the removal of nasal packing, patients indicated which side caused more discomfort on removal.

The subjects received the standard conventional treatment (fluticasone nasal spray plus normal saline solution irrigation) or the conventional treatment plus 250 mg of azithromycin on a daily basis for 3 months. Evaluation was made based on the 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) immediately before surgery and 3 months after surgery.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThe intervention group showed a statistically significant improvement in SNOT-22 scores after the treatment and a higher percentage change after 3 months of therapy compared with the control group. A significant correlation was found between the percentage change of SNOT-22 scores and smoking in the placebo group. Lund-Mackay scores, patient age, and the duration of symptoms had no significant correlation with the percentage change.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nTreatment with long-term low-dose azithromycin in combination with the conventional therapy could statistically reduce the recurrence rate of CRS symptoms after functional endoscopic sinus surgery, but there was not sufficient evidence to support clinical significance of azithromycin at the investigated dose.

An ear-related measure of quality of life (QoL) [a 14-point questionnaire on the impact of OME (OMQ-14)], weekly diary recorded symptoms, compliance and adverse events were all secondary outcomes.\nRESULTS\n\n\nAt 1 month, the proportion of children with normal tympanograms was 47.3% (62/131) in those allocated to autoinflation and 35.6% (47/132) in those receiving usual care [adjusted relative risk (RR) 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99 to 1.88]. At 3 months, the proportions were 49.6% (62/125) and 38.3% (46/120), respectively (adjusted RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.83; number needed to treat\u2009=\u20099). The change in OMQ-14 also favoured the intervention arm (adjusted global score difference -0.42; p\u2009=\u20090.001). Reported compliance was good: 89% in the first month and 80% in months 2 and 3. Adverse events included otalgia in 4% of treated children compared with 1% in the control group. Minor nosebleeds (14% vs. 15%) and respiratory tract infections (18% vs. 13%) were noted.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nWe found the use of autoinflation in young children with OME to be feasible in primary care and effective in both clearing effusions and improving child and parent ear-related QoL and symptoms. This method has scope to be used more widely. Further research is needed for very young children, and to inform prudent use in different health settings.","t9":"Efficacy of Povidone-Iodine Nasal Irrigation Solution After Sinonasal Surgery: A Randomized Controlled Study.","p9":"However, there were no significant differences between the two groups in TWSNOT-22, endoscopic, or TNR scores 3\u2009months after the operation (all, P\u2009>\u2009.05).\n","a9_doc":"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS\n\n\nTo evaluate the efficacy of postoperative nasal irrigation with povidone-iodine (PVP-I) solution in patients undergoing sinonasal surgery.\nSTUDY DESIGN\n\n\nSingle-blind, randomized controlled study.\nMETHODS\n\n\nThis is a prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled study.

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) associated with drug therapy in comparison to drug therapy alone on the QOL and symptoms of IBS patients with diarrhea predominance. This study was a randomized clinical trial on 64 IBS patients. The patients were selected according to Rome III criteria and were assigned into two groups. Bowel symptom severity and frequency scale and QOL-IBS were used to investigate the patients' symptoms. The first group underwent CBT with medication therapy, and the second group received only medication. Data were analyzed using analysis of multiple covariance. The two groups showed a significant difference in the QOL-IBS in posttreatment and follow-up stages ( P  < 0.05). There were significant differences in the severity and frequency of IBS symptoms between the two groups after the intervention ( P  < 0.05). However, no significant difference was observed at follow-up stage between the two groups ( P  > 0.05). CBT accompanied by drug therapy can be useful for IBS patients with diarrhea predominance.

Twenty-five subjects (17 females, 8 males), who were not receiving treatment for IBS, rated the severity of their IBS symptoms daily for 8 weeks. Four symptoms' (abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, constipation and diarrhea) ratings were slimmed to create a primary IBS symptom score. The data were detrended, then a time-series analysis was performed. Many subjects' IBS severity was predictable over more than one day, and symptoms tended to occur in clusters rather than randomly. Anxiety and depression were slightly to moderately correlated with IBS variables, but virtually all of these correlations were nonsignificant.","t7":"A positive diagnostic strategy is noninferior to a strategy of exclusion for patients with irritable bowel syndrome.","p7":"A positive strategy was noninferior to a strategy of exclusion (difference, 0.64;","a7_doc":"BACKGROUND & AIMS\n\n\nGuidelines recommend a positive strategy based on symptom criteria to diagnose patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

Patients who fulfilled the Rome III criteria for IBS with no alarm signals were randomly assigned to groups assessed by a strategy of exclusion (analyses of blood, stool samples for intestinal parasites, and sigmoidoscopies with biopsies) or a positive strategy (analyses of blood cell count and C-reactive protein). Patients were followed for 1 year. The primary end point was difference in change of HRQOL from baseline to 1 year between groups (on the basis of the Short Form 36 health survey, physical component summary, and noninferiority margin of 3 points). Secondary outcomes were change in gastrointestinal symptoms, satisfaction with management, and use of resources. Findings of diagnostic misclassification were registered.\nRESULTS\n\n\nA positive strategy was noninferior to a strategy of exclusion (difference, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, -2.74 to 1.45). The positive diagnostic strategy had lower direct costs. Each approach had similar effects on symptoms, satisfaction, and subsequent use of health resources. No cases of inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, or celiac disease were found.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nIn diagnosing IBS in primary care, use of a positive diagnostic strategy is noninferior to using a strategy of exclusion with regard to the patients' HRQOL.

Recently, it was revealed that low grade mucosal inflammation and/or immune imbalance of the lower digestive tract is one of the mechanisms involved in symptom generation in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Biobran, arabinoxylan compound derived from rice bran, has been reported to have several biological actions such as anti-inflammatory and immune modulatory effects. So we investigated the therapeutic effects of Biobran in patients with IBS. Method. Forty patients with diarrhea predominant or mixed type IBS were randomly assigned to either a Biobran group for treatment with Biobran or a placebo group. Therapeutic efficacy and IBS symptoms were assessed subjectively by the patients after 4 weeks of administration. Results. The global assessment was effective in 63.2% of the Biobran group and in 30% of the placebo group (P < 0.05, Biobran group versus placebo group). Biobran group showed a significant decrease in the score of diarrhea and constipation and in CRP value. However, no significant changes were observed in the placebo group. Conclusion. The administration of Biobran improved IBS symptoms. It is likely that anti-inflammatory and/or immune modulatory effects of Biobran might be useful in IBS patients.","t10":"A mechanistic multicentre, parallel group, randomised placebo-controlled trial of mesalazine for the treatment of IBS with diarrhoea (IBS-D).","p10":"Mesalazine did not improve abdominal pain, stool consistency nor percentage with satisfactory relief compared with placebo during the last two-weeks follow-up.\n","a10_doc":"INTRODUCTION\n\n\nImmune activation has been reported in the mucosa of IBS patients with diarrhoea (IBS-D), and some small studies have suggested that mesalazine may reduce symptoms.

Xaggitin XL 18mg ( now on 36mg and then will go to 54mg ). It seems to work ... I wake up a lot easier as before I would wake up groggy and just completely unfunctional .. which would then lead to me being easily distracted etc, and my focus throughout the day seems improved ... mood seems improved ... but, at around 4pm I crash hard and just feel exhausted at night. I had some family over at the weekend and was unable to keep up in conversation. Also after a few days it seems to have less of an effect ... but then I up the dose and it works again. Obviously this won't be sustainable and I will eventually reach max dose.  \n\n\nI would like to try Elvanse next as I've heard people say the come down is less brutal ... but it takes longer to kick in, which is a problem for me as I find it most difficult in the morning. I could wake earlier and take it, and then go back to bed ... or I've also seen some people who take Amfexa as a top up in the morning and then take Elvanse for the rest of the day. This seems totally ideal for me, and has the benefit where I can forgo the meds on weekends if I'm not working / doing much - but have the quick release to fall back on in the event something crops up.  \n\n\nThe question is - can I request this? I scared to accept a med just because it works somewhat, as changing it seems like it would be a pain in the ass .. so I'd like to make an informed decision.. but also don't want to waste their time. I'm also scared to even mention Amfexa for fear of being labeled as someone just wanting a high.","claim":"I would like to try Elvanse next as I've heard people say the come down is less brutal ... but it takes longer to kick in","t1":"Sex differences in effectiveness of extended-release stimulant medication among adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.","p1":"No interactions were found between sex and medication on any measure of effectiveness or side effects.","a1_doc":"This study examined whether adolescent females with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are differentially responsive than their male counterparts to extended-release stimulant medications. This investigation may bear special importance for an adolescent (as opposed to child) population, because hormonal and metabolism differences between sexes are most likely to emerge at this time. Male (n = 19) and female (n = 16) adolescents, ages 16-19 with ADHD, participated in a randomized, double-blind crossover study evaluating the effectiveness of osmotic-release methylphenidate, extended release amphetamine salts, placebo, and routine limited medication regimen. Medication efficacy was evaluated using ADHD symptom ratings from adolescent self-report and parent report, along with objective measures of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity during driving performance and neuropsychological tasks. Males and females were largely equivalent in impairment, and medication was similarly effective in reducing symptoms. No interactions were found between sex and medication on any measure of effectiveness or side effects. This finding suggests that the efficacy and tolerability of extended-release stimulant medications is equivalent for male and female adolescents with ADHD.","t2":"Guanfacine extended release for children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: efficacy following prior methylphenidate treatment.","p2":"GXR response was unaffected by prior stimulant treatment; ATX produced improvement only in stimulant-na\u00efve participants relative to placebo.","a2_doc":"Guanfacine extended release (GXR) and atomoxetine (ATX) are nonstimulant treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). As nonstimulant treatments are often used after stimulants in ADHD, GXR was assessed relative to prior stimulant treatment in a randomized controlled trial (RCT), in which ATX was included as a reference arm, and in the open-label phase of a randomized-withdrawal study (RWS). Participants were 6-17 years old with ADHD Rating Scale version IV (ADHD-RS-IV) scores \u226532 and Clinical Global Impressions - Severity scores \u22654. RCT participants received dose-optimized GXR (1-7 mg/day), ATX (10-100 mg/day), or placebo for 10-13 weeks. RWS participants received dose-optimized GXR (1-7 mg/day) for 13 weeks. Participants' last stimulant medication prior to enrolment, and reasons for stopping this medication, were collected at baseline. Change from baseline ADHD-RS-IV score and the proportion of responders were assessed by prior stimulant exposure. Of 163 RCT and 296 RWS participants who had previously received stimulant treatment, 142 and 224, respectively, had received methylphenidate (MPH); due to the low number of participants and the heterogeneity of non-MPH treatments, we only report data for prior MPH treatment. The most frequent reasons for stopping MPH were lack of effectiveness or side effects. Placebo-adjusted ADHD-RS-IV changes from baseline were significant in participants receiving GXR (prior MPH, -9.8, P<0.001, effect size [ES] 0.85; stimulant-na\u00efve, -7.6, P<0.001, ES 0.65). In ATX-treated participants, significant placebo-adjusted differences were seen in stimulant-na\u00efve (-5.0, P=0.022, ES 0.43) but not prior MPH-treated (-1.8, P>0.05, ES 0.15) participants. More participants met responder criteria with GXR versus placebo, regardless of prior treatment. GXR response was unaffected by prior stimulant treatment; ATX produced improvement only in stimulant-na\u00efve participants relative to placebo. These findings may be relevant to clinical decision-making regarding sequencing of ADHD treatments.","t3":"Efficacy of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate for promoting occupational success in adolescents and young adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.","p3":"Ratings of job application quality, job interview performance, and delivery outcomes were not significantly different on medication versus placebo.","a3_doc":"There has been a lack of research on the third area of impairment noted in the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition -\"occupational functioning.\" It is important to understand the impact of common treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in occupational settings. Twenty individuals with ADHD between ages 16 and 25 participated in a double-blind, placebo controlled evaluation of 40 mg lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in a setting designed to approximate a restaurant workplace with associated, simulated food delivery. Outcome measures included ratings of performance, as well as behavioral productivity. Results indicated that participants completed more workplace tasks when on medication, relative to placebo. Ratings of job application quality, job interview performance, and delivery outcomes were not significantly different on medication versus placebo. These results suggest positive effects of medication in a workplace environment, but also a need for study of additional interventions to support workplace-related behavior and functioning.

Additionally, patient-, disorder- and treatment-related factors associated with adherence and persistence will be identified.\nMETHOD\n\n\nPost-hoc analysis of the active treatment group of a placebo-controlled, randomised, 24 week trial with MPH-ER with univariate description and multiple logistic regression models and Hosmer and Lemeshow tests.\nRESULTS\n\n\nIn the sample of 241 adults with ADHD (mean age of 35.2 \u00b1 10.1 years), 9.4% of the patients were non-adherent, taking less than 80% of the dispensed medication. Factors associated with non-adherence included age<25 years, education level lower than secondary education, lacking family history of ADHD, lower ADHD baseline severity and lower self- and observer-rated medication efficacy. Lacking family history of ADHD, lower education level and lower self-rated medication efficacy, predicted non-adherence with a prediction accuracy of 16%. Seventeen percent of the patients discontinued early with most discontinuing within the first five weeks of the MPH-ER titration phase. Mean persistence in the discontinuing group was 63.4 \u00b1 49.4 days. Factors associated with discontinuation included male gender, lower education level, lacking family history of ADHD and lower self- and observer-rated medication efficacy. Treatment non-response, male gender and lower education level predicted treatment discontinuation with a prediction accuracy of 22.7%.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nMale adults without relatives with ADHD, with lower educational level and lower self- and observer-rated medication efficacy, who are newly treated with MPH-ER, are at increased risk of non-adherence and treatment discontinuation.

Treatment effects were assessed by using direct observations of child behavior in a simulated (clinic-based) classroom and behavior rating scales completed by parents and clinician.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThere was no change (group data) in the frequency or severity of motor tics or vocal tics during the placebo condition compared with maintenance dose of stimulant medication (ie, no evidence of tic exacerbation while receiving medication or of a withdrawal reaction). There was no evidence of tic exacerbation in the evening as a rebound effect. Treatment with the maintenance dose was also associated with behavioral improvement in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder behaviors, indicating continued efficacy.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nAbrupt withdrawal of stimulant medication in children receiving long-term maintenance therapy does not appear to result in worsening of tic frequency or severity. Nevertheless, these findings do not preclude the possibility of drug withdrawal reactions in susceptible individuals.","t9":"Pharmacokinetics of Coadministered Viloxazine Extended-Release (SPN-812) and Methylphenidate in Healthy Adults.","p9":"For viloxazine ER, maximum measured plasma concentration (C max )\u2009=\u2009100.98% (96.21-105.99), area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the last measurable time (AUC t )\u2009=\u200998.62% (96.21-101.08), and area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC \u221e )\u2009=\u200998.96% (96.55-101.44).","a9_doc":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES\n\n\nViloxazine extended-release (viloxazine ER, SPN-812) is a novel non-stimulant with activity at serotonin receptors and the norepinephrine transporter, which is under investigation as a potential treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Given the potential for viloxazine ER to be coadministered with other pharmacotherapies, this trial investigated the pharmacokinetics and safety of combination viloxazine ER\u2009+\u2009methylphenidate versus viloxazine ER or methylphenidate alone.\nMETHODS\n\n\nIn this single-center, crossover, open-label trial, healthy adult participants received oral administration of 700\u00a0mg viloxazine ER alone, 36\u00a0mg methylphenidate alone, and combination viloxazine ER (700\u00a0mg)\u2009+\u2009methylphenidate (36\u00a0mg), with blood samples collected over 4\u00a0days post-administration. The active drug in viloxazine ER (viloxazine) and methylphenidate was measured using chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry. Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs), vital signs, echocardiograms, and clinical laboratory evaluations.\nRESULTS\n\n\nOf 36 healthy adults who were enrolled, 34 completed the trial. The geometric least squares mean ratios are reported as [combination/single drug (90% confidence intervals)]. For viloxazine ER, maximum measured plasma concentration (C max )\u2009=\u2009100.98% (96.21-105.99), area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the last measurable time (AUC t )\u2009=\u200998.62% (96.21-101.08), and area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC \u221e )\u2009=\u200998.96% (96.55-101.44). For methylphenidate, C max \u2009=\u2009103.55% (97.42-110.07), AUC t \u2009=\u2009106.67% (101.01-112.64), and AUC \u221e \u2009=\u2009106.61% (100.99-112.54). All reported AEs were mild in severity.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nCoadministration of viloxazine ER and methylphenidate did not impact the pharmacokinetics of viloxazine or methylphenidate relative to administration of either drug alone. The combination appeared to be safe and well tolerated.","t10":"Tolerability of High-Dose Venlafaxine After Switch From Escitalopram in Nonresponding Patients With Major Depressive Disorder.","p10":"The switch of medication led to an increase of ADRs such as reduced salivation (+11%), orthostatic dizziness (+11%), and sweating (+9.8%).","a10_doc":"BACKGROUND\n\n\nWithin a single depressive episode, most patients receive different antidepressants because of an inadequate response to the first-line antidepressant. A commonly used strategy is to switch from a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor to a selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. However, little is known about the tolerability of this switch with consideration of dose and drug concentration in blood.\nMETHODS\n\n\nAfter 4 weeks of inadequate response to escitalopram (10-20 mg/d), medication was switched to another 4 weeks of venlafaxine (VF, 150-375 mg/d) in 234 depressed patients. Serum concentrations, depression severity, and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were assessed weekly.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThe switch of medication led to an increase of ADRs such as reduced salivation (+11%), orthostatic dizziness (+11%), and sweating (+9.8%). The most frequent ADRs during treatment with VF were reduced salivation (28.6%), sweating (24.6%), and orthostatic dizziness (15.8%). In patients receiving high-dose VF, a significant improvement of depressive symptomatology was observed, and most ADRs decreased during the course of treatment, even in patients above the therapeutic reference range.\nLIMITATIONS\n\n\nPatients and physicians were aware of medication, and there was no direct comparison with the herein presented switch of medication.\nIMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis study provides important information about the tolerability of a commonly used antidepressant treatment strategy. More detailed information about putative ADRs may help clinicians increase compliance through effective patient education. Because ADRs of VF were associated with the plasma concentration, therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended to guide the therapy and manage problems of tolerability.","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnwb","post_id":"s80bwa","stage2_labels":"[{\"crowd-entity-annotation\":{\"entities\":[{\"endOffset\":801,\"label\":\"intervention\",\"startOffset\":793}]}}]","text":"Picking the correct meds?\nSo I'm UK based and have just started titration through PsychiatryUK after waiting nearly a year.   \n\n\nStarted on Xaggitin XL 18mg ( now on 36mg and then will go to 54mg ). It seems to work ... I wake up a lot easier as before I would wake up groggy and just completely unfunctional .. which would then lead to me being easily distracted etc, and my focus throughout the day seems improved ... mood seems improved ... but, at around 4pm I crash hard and just feel exhausted at night. I had some family over at the weekend and was unable to keep up in conversation. Also after a few days it seems to have less of an effect ... but then I up the dose and it works again. Obviously this won't be sustainable and I will eventually reach max dose.  \n\n\nI would like to try Elvanse next as I've heard people say the come down is less brutal ... but it takes longer to kick in, which is a problem for me as I find it most difficult in the morning. I could wake earlier and take it, and then go back to bed ... or I've also seen some people who take Amfexa as a top up in the morning and then take Elvanse for the rest of the day. This seems totally ideal for me, and has the benefit where I can forgo the meds on weekends if I'm not working / doing much - but have the quick release to fall back on in the event something crops up.  \n\n\nThe question is - can I request this? I scared to accept a med just because it works somewhat, as changing it seems like it would be a pain in the ass .. so I'd like to make an informed decision.. but also don't want to waste their time. I'm also scared to even mention Amfexa for fear of being labeled as someone just wanting a
