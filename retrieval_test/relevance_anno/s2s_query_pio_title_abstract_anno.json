The objectives of these post hoc analyses of the global Phase III 093-0304 trial (NCT00988429, Study 304) of adjunctive eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL) in patients with refractory focal (partial-onset) seizures (FS) were to evaluate associations between seizure severity change, measured by the Seizure Severity Questionnaire (SSQ), and 1) patient characteristics, 2) seizure frequency change, standardized as the seizure frequency (SSF) per 28-day period, and 3) change in HRQoL, evaluated by the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory-31 (QOLIE-31) and the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). The analyses were conducted on the per-protocol population (PPP) of patients who were randomized to a placebo arm (n\u202f=\u202f188) or an ESL-active group that included treatment with adjunctive ESL 800\u202fmg once daily (QD; n\u202f=\u202f184) or adjunctive ESL 1200\u202fmg QD (n\u202f=\u202f175). General linear models (GLM) were used to measure the association between SSQ change and patient baseline characteristics or percentage change in the SSF from baseline. Associations between changes in the SSQ and changes in the QOLIE-31 and MADRS were examined using GLM with patient baseline characteristics as covariates. Subgroup analyses were performed for patients in the ESL-active group and those treated with ESL 800\u202fmg or ESL 1200\u202fmg. Minimal clinically important difference (MCIDs) thresholds were used to assess improvements in SSQ scores. The analyses included 547 per-protocol patients. Patients using 1 antiepileptic drug (AED) at baseline had greater improvements in the SSQ compared with those receiving 2 AEDs (P\u202f=\u202f0.0606). Treatment with ESL 1200\u202fmg was significantly associated with clinically meaningful improvements in the SSQ (P\u202f=\u202f0.0005). The SSQ improvements were significantly associated with an SSF reduction of \u226575%, compared with no reduction (P\u202f<\u202f0.0001). In the PPP and the ESL-active group, SSQ improvements were significantly associated with improvements in QOLIE-31 Total Score (TS; P\u202f<\u202f0.0001) and the Seizure Worry (SW; P\u202f<\u202f0.0001) and Social Functioning (SF; P\u202f=\u202f0.0030) subscales. In the ESL 1200\u202fmg subgroup, SSQ improvements were significantly associated with improvements in QOLIE-31 TS (P\u202f<\u202f0.0001) and the SW (P\u202f<\u202f0.0001) and Energy/Fatigue (EF; P\u202f=\u202f0.0007) subscales. In the ESL 800\u202fmg subgroup, improvements in the SSQ were significantly associated with improvements in QOLIE-31 TS (P\u202f=\u202f0.0362) and the SW (P\u202f=\u202f0.0241) subscale. There was no significant association between changes in the SSQ and changes in the MADRS in patients treated with ESL. These findings demonstrated that in this clinical trial population, adding ESL to baseline AED therapy had utility for decreasing seizure severity and improving HRQoL. There were no significant associations between changes in seizure severity and changes in depressive symptoms in patients with FS.","t2":"Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 study of ganaxolone as add-on therapy in adults with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures.","p2":"From baseline to endpoint, mean weekly seizure frequency decreased with ganaxolone (6.5-5.2) versus placebo (9.2-10.8), representing an 11.4% decrease versus placebo (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0489, analysis of covariance [ANCOVA]).","a2_doc":"OBJECTIVE\n\n\nTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of ganaxolone as adjunctive therapy in adults with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures despite taking up to three concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).\nMETHODS\n\n\nAdults aged 18-69\u00a0years and refractory to conventional AEDs were enrolled in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. After an 8-week baseline period, patients were randomized 2:1 to ganaxolone 1,500\u00a0mg/day or placebo for a 10-week treatment period (2-week forced titration and 8-week maintenance) followed by either tapering or entry into an open-label extension study. The primary endpoint was mean weekly seizure frequency. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients experiencing \u226550% reduction in seizure frequency (responder rate), percent change in mean weekly seizure frequency, seizure-free days, and quality of life. Safety and tolerability assessments included adverse events (AEs), treatment discontinuation, and clinical laboratory evaluations. Efficacy analyses were performed on the intent-to-treat population.\nRESULTS\n\n\nOf 147 randomized patients (98 ganaxolone, 49 placebo), 131 completed the study; 95% of participants titrated up to 1,500\u00a0mg/day and 78% maintained this dose.

Mean percent change from baseline was -17.6% with ganaxolone versus 2.0% with placebo (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0144, Kruskal-Wallis test). Responder rates were 24% with ganaxolone versus 15% with placebo (p\u00a0=\u00a00.19). Discontinuation due to adverse events was similar with ganaxolone (7.1%) and placebo (6.1%). Common adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and included dizziness (16.3% vs. 8.2%), fatigue (16.3% vs. 8.2%), and somnolence (13.3% vs. 2.0%).\nSIGNIFICANCE\n\n\nGanaxolone 1,500\u00a0mg/day reduced partial-onset seizure frequency and was generally safe and well tolerated in this phase 2 study.

On day 15, each subject ingested 80 mg simvastatin. Serum concentrations of simvastatin and its active metabolite simvastatin acid were measured up to 24 h.\nRESULTS\n\n\nCarbamazepine decreased the mean total area under the serum concentration-time curve of simvastatin and simvastatin acid by 75% ( P<0.001) and 82% ( P<0.001), respectively. The mean peak concentrations of both simvastatin and simvastatin acid were reduced by 68% ( P<0.01), and half-life of simvastatin acid was shortened from 5.9+/-0.3 h to 3.7+/-0.5 h ( P<0.01) by carbamazepine.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nCarbamazepine greatly reduces the serum concentrations of simvastatin and simvastatin acid, probably by inducing their metabolism. Concomitant administration of carbamazepine and simvastatin should be avoided or the dose of simvastatin should be considerably increased.","t4":"Efficacy, tolerability, and safety of rapid initiation of topiramate versus phenytoin in patients with new-onset epilepsy: a randomized double-blind clinical trial.","p4":"A post hoc analysis showed that TPM was superior to PHT in time to discontinuation (retention rate) for all causes (89.4% vs. 80.3%, p = 0.047).\n","a4_doc":"PURPOSE\n\n\nTo evaluate topiramate (TPM) and phenytoin (PHT) monotherapy following rapid oral initiation in new-onset epilepsy.\nMETHODS\n\n\nRandomized, double-blind, 28-day trial of TPM (100 mg/day beginning on day 1) versus PHT (1,000 mg on day 1 followed by 300 mg/day maintenance dosing) in 261 patients with new-onset epilepsy. The primary end point was time to seizure, and the primary objective was to establish noninferiority of TPM to PHT in the risk of seizure.\nRESULTS\n\n\nAt day 28, the estimated seizure-free rate was 81.1% for TPM treatment in comparison with 90.3% for PHT treatment. Noninferiority of TPM to PHT (primary objective) could not be established [hazard ratio (HR) 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.98 to 4.12, p = 0.366), and PHT could not be shown to be superior to TPM. A higher percentage discontinued with PHT compared to TPM for all reasons (21.1 vs. 12.8%) and due to adverse events (13.4 vs. 6.8%). The most common treatment-related adverse events in both groups were dizziness, paresthesia, and somnolence. A post hoc analysis showed that TPM was superior to PHT in time to discontinuation (retention rate) for all causes (89.4% vs. 80.3%, p = 0.047).\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThis study was inconclusive in establishing noninferiority of TPM 100 mg/day compared to a standard regimen of oral PHT in seizure risk in this population of patients with new-onset epilepsy. Given the superiority of TPM in overall retention and favorable tolerability without titration, it may nonetheless be an appropriate option in some patients with new-onset epilepsy requiring rapid treatment initiation.","t5":"The influence of established and new antiepileptic drugs on visual perception. 1. A placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-dose study in healthy volunteers.","p5":"After VGB, increment, postadaptation and transient tritanopia thresholds and the critical flicker fusion increased, whereas GBP led to a somewhat converse profile.","a5_doc":"The influence of single oral dosages of carbamazepine (CBZ), valproic acid, vigabatrin (VGB), lamotrigine (LTG), gabapentin (GBP), and losigamone (LSG) on visual perception was investigated in ten healthy volunteers according to a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study design. The test battery comprised visual acuity, the Lanthony-D-15-d\u00e9satur\u00e9 colour perception test, increment, postadaptation and transient tritanopia threshold measurements, perception threshold assessment for monochromatic and chromatic gaussian dots, monochromatic gratings and gratings of differing spatial frequency, and critical flicker fusion tests with various stimuli. The only consistent and partly significant effects were seen after VGB and GBP. After VGB, increment, postadaptation and transient tritanopia thresholds and the critical flicker fusion increased, whereas GBP led to a somewhat converse profile. The other tests were not influenced consistently by any antiepileptic drug (AED). We conclude that: (i) gamma-amino-butyric acid-(GABA)-related properties as under the prototype drug VGB result in specific alterations of the transient tritanopia phenomenon which is consistent with the physiological hypothesis for this retinal paradigm based on extracellular recordings in primates. The possible mechanisms why VGB improved critical flicker fusion as the only AED in this trial are discussed. The profile of GBP indicates a unique mechanism of action. We have not observed specific influences on visual perception under AEDs which act mainly via alterations of ion membrane conductance. The transient tritanopia and flicker fusion paradigms we used appear to be promising to investigate antiepileptic drugs with hitherto unknown modes of actions in human noninvasively.","t6":"Efficacy and tolerability of adjunctive brivaracetam in adults with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures: a phase IIb, randomized, controlled trial.","p6":"During the treatment period, this was 34.9% for BRV50 (p = 0.004) and 28.3% for BRV150 (p = 0.070) compared with 16.3% for placebo.","a6_doc":"PURPOSE\n\n\nTo evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of adjunctive brivaracetam (BRV), a novel high-affinity synaptic vesicle protein 2A ligand that also displays inhibitory activity at neuronal voltage-dependent sodium channels, in adult epilepsy patients with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures.\nMETHODS\n\n\nA phase IIb, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging study (N01114; NCT00175929) was conducted in patients aged 16-65 years. To be included in the study, patients were required to have experienced four or more partial-onset seizures during a 4-week prospective baseline, despite treatment with 1-2 concomitant antiepileptic drugs. Patients were randomized in a ratio of 1:1:1 to receive BRV 50 mg/day (BRV50), 150 mg/day (BRV150), or placebo. A 3-week up-titration period was followed by a 7-week maintenance period (total treatment period of 10 weeks).\nKEY FINDINGS\n\n\nA total of 157 patients were randomized (intent-to-treat [ITT] population; BRV50 n = 53, BRV150 n = 52, placebo n = 52) and overall 148 (94.3%) completed the study. The percent reduction in baseline-adjusted partial-onset seizure frequency/week over placebo during the 7-week maintenance period (primary efficacy outcome) did not reach statistical significance (14.7% for BRV50 [p = 0.093] and 13.6% for BRV150 [p = 0.124]).

Fifty percent responder rates during the maintenance period were 23.1% for placebo compared with 39.6% for BRV50 (odds ratio [OR] 2.17, p = 0.077) and 33.3% for BRV150 (OR 1.66, p = 0.261). During the treatment period, 50% responder rates were 17.3% for placebo compared with 35.8% for BRV50 (OR 2.69, p = 0.038) and 30.8% for BRV150 (OR 2.15, p = 0.114). Nine patients were free from partial-onset seizures during the 10-week treatment period (five patients [9.4%] in the BRV50 group and three [5.8%] in the BRV150 group compared with one patient [1.9%] in the placebo group). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported during the treatment period were mostly mild-to-moderate with similar incidence across treatment groups (BRV50 36/53, 67.9%; BRV150 35/52, 67.3%; placebo 37/52, 71.2%).

The vigabatrin and placebo groups were highly similar at entry into the study. At the end of the study, there were no differences between the vigabatrin and placebo groups on any cognitive variable or on any measure of mood and adjustment. Analysis of the results related to relief from seizures demonstrated only chance findings. In a similar manner, there were no relationships between vigabatrin serum levels at the end of the study and changes on measures of abilities and adjustment.

This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04864561, and is ongoing.\nRESULTS\n\n\nA booster dose of VLA2001 was administered to 958 participants, of whom 712 had been primed with VLA2001, and 246 with ChAdOx1-S. Within 7 days following these booster doses, 607 (63.4%) participants reported solicited injection site reactions, and 487 (50.8%) reported solicited systemic reactions. Up to 14 days post booster, 751 (78.4%) participants reported at least one adverse event. The tolerability profile of a booster dose of VLA2001 was similar in VLA2001-primed and ChAdOx1-S-primed participants. In VLA2001-primed participants, the GMT (95% CI) of neutralizing antibodies increased from 32.5 (22.8, 46.3) immediately before to 521.5 (413.0, 658.6) 2 weeks after administration of the booster dose, this corresponds to a geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) of 27.7 (20.0, 38.5). Compared to 2 weeks after the second priming dose, the GMFR was 3.6 (2.8, 4.7). In the ChAdOx1-S primed group, the GMT (95% CI) of neutralizing antibodies increased from 65.8 (43.9, 98.4) immediately before to 188.3 (140.3, 252.8) 2 weeks after administration of the booster dose, a geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) of 3.0 (2.2, 4.0). Compared to 2 weeks after the second priming dose, the GMFR was 1.6 (1.1, 2.2). For S-protein binding IgG antibodies, the pre- versus post-booster GMT fold ratio (95% CI) was 34.6 (25.0, 48.0) in the VLA2001-primed group and 4.0 (3.0, 5.2) in the ChAdOx1-S-primed group. Compared to 2 weeks after the second priming dose, the GMT fold rise of IgG antibodies was 3.8 (3.2, 4.6) in the VLA2001-primed group and 1.2 (0.9, 1.6) in the ChAdOx1-S-primed group. The GMT against Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (BA.4/5) increased from 4.2 to 260, and from 2.7 to 56.7, respectively, when boosting subjects previously primed with VLA2001. Following the boost, 97% of subjects primed with VLA2001 had detectable Delta- and 94% Omicron-neutralizing antibodies. In subjects primed with ChAdOx1-S, the GMT against Delta and Omicron titres increased from 9.1 to 92.5, and from 3.6 to 12.3, respectively. After boosting, 99% of subjects primed with ChAdOx1-S had detectable Delta- and 70% Omicron-neutralizing antibodies. In both VLA2001 and ChAdOx1-S primed subjects, the additional VLA2001 dose boosted T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 antigens to levels above those observed before the booster dose.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nA booster dose of VLA2001 was safe and well tolerated after primary immunization with VLA2001 and ChAdOx1-S. The tolerability of a booster dose of VLA2001 was similar to the favourable profile observed after the first and second priming doses. Both in a homologous and a heterologous setting, boosting resulted in higher neutralizing antibody titres than after primary immunization and significant increases in cross-neutralization titres against Delta and Omicron were observed after the booster dose. These data support the use of VLA2001 in booster programmes in ChadOx1-S primed groups.","t8":"A Phase 2 Randomized Trial Evaluating the Antiviral Activity and Safety of the Direct-Acting Antiviral Bemnifosbuvir in Ambulatory Patients with Mild or Moderate COVID-19 (MOONSONG Study).","p8":"the difference in viral RNA adjusted means at day 7 was -0.25","a8_doc":"Bemnifosbuvir is an oral antiviral drug with a dual mechanism of action targeting viral RNA polymerase, with  in vitro  activity against SARS-CoV-2. We conducted a phase 2, double-blind study evaluating the antiviral activity, safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of bemnifosbuvir in ambulatory patients with mild/moderate COVID-19. Patients were randomized 1:1 to bemnifosbuvir 550\u2009mg or placebo (cohort A) and 3:1 to bemnifosbuvir 1,100\u2009mg or placebo (cohort B); all doses were given twice daily for 5\u2009days. The primary endpoint was a change from baseline in the amount of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). The modified intent-to-treat infected population comprised 100 patients (bemnifosbuvir 550\u2009mg,  n\u2009 =\u200930; bemnifosbuvir 1,100\u2009mg,  n\u2009 =\u200930; cohort A placebo,  n\u2009 =\u200930; cohort B placebo,  n\u2009 =\u200910). The primary endpoint was not met: the difference in viral RNA adjusted means at day 7 was -0.25 log 10  copies/mL between bemnifosbuvir 550\u2009mg and cohort A placebo (80% confidence interval [CI], -0.66 to 0.16;  P \u2009=\u20090.4260), and -0.08 log 10  copies/mL between bemnifosbuvir 1,100\u2009mg and pooled placebo (80% CI, -0.48 to 0.33;  P \u2009=\u20090.8083). Bemnifosbuvir 550\u2009mg was well tolerated. Incidence of nausea and vomiting was higher with bemnifosbuvir 1,100\u2009mg (10.0% and 16.7% of patients, respectively) than pooled placebo (2.5% nausea, 2.5% vomiting). In the primary analysis, bemnifosbuvir did not show meaningful antiviral activity on nasopharyngeal viral load as measured by RT-PCR compared with placebo in patients with mild/moderate COVID-19. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration number NCT04709835.  IMPORTANCE  COVID-19 continues to be a major global public health challenge, and there remains a need for effective and convenient direct-acting antivirals that can be administered outside health care settings. Bemnifosbuvir is an oral antiviral with a dual mechanism of action and potent  in vitro  activity against SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we evaluated the antiviral activity, safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of bemnifosbuvir in ambulatory patients with mild/moderate COVID-19. In the primary analysis, bemnifosbuvir did not show meaningful antiviral activity compared with placebo as assessed by nasopharyngeal viral loads. The negative predictive value of nasopharyngeal viral load reduction for clinical outcomes in COVID-19 is currently unclear, and further evaluation of bemnifosbuvir for COVID-19 may be warranted despite the findings observed in this study.","t9":"Triple combination of interferon beta-1b, lopinavir-ritonavir, and ribavirin in the treatment of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19: an open-label, randomised, phase 2 trial.","p9":"Adverse events included self-limited nausea and diarrhoea with no difference between the two groups.","a9_doc":"BACKGROUND\n\n\nEffective antiviral therapy is important for tackling the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We assessed the efficacy and safety of combined interferon beta-1b, lopinavir-ritonavir, and ribavirin for treating patients with COVID-19.\nMETHODS\n\n\nThis was a multicentre, prospective, open-label, randomised, phase 2 trial in adults with COVID-19 who were admitted to six hospitals in Hong Kong. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to a 14-day combination of lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg every 12 h, ribavirin 400 mg every 12 h, and three doses of 8 million international units of interferon beta-1b on alternate days (combination group) or to 14 days of lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg every 12 h (control group). The primary endpoint was the time to providing a nasopharyngeal swab negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RT-PCR, and was done in the intention-to-treat population. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04276688.\nFINDINGS\n\n\nBetween Feb 10 and March 20, 2020, 127 patients were recruited; 86 were randomly assigned to the combination group and 41 were assigned to the control group. The median number of days from symptom onset to start of study treatment was 5 days (IQR 3-7). The combination group had a significantly shorter median time from start of study treatment to negative nasopharyngeal swab (7 days [IQR 5-11]) than the control group (12 days [8-15]; hazard ratio 4\u00b737 [95% CI 1\u00b786-10\u00b724], p=0\u00b70010). Adverse events included self-limited nausea and diarrhoea with no difference between the two groups. One patient in the control group discontinued lopinavir-ritonavir because of biochemical hepatitis. No patients died during the study.\nINTERPRETATION\n\n\nEarly triple antiviral therapy was safe and superior to lopinavir-ritonavir alone in alleviating symptoms and shortening the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Future clinical study of a double antiviral therapy with interferon beta-1b as a backbone is warranted.\nFUNDING\n\n\nThe Shaw-Foundation, Richard and Carol Yu, May Tam Mak Mei Yin, and Sanming Project of Medicine.","t10":"Consistent Effects of Early Remdesivir on Symptoms and Disease Progression Across At-Risk Outpatient Subgroups: Treatment Effect Heterogeneity in PINETREE Study.","p10":"Treatment with remdesivir reduced COVID-19-related hospitalizations independent of stratification by time from symptom onset to randomization.","a10_doc":"INTRODUCTION\n\n\nIn the PINETREE study, early remdesivir treatment reduced risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related hospitalizations or all-cause death versus placebo by 87% by day\u00a028 in high-risk, non-hospitalized patients. Here we report results of assessment of heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE) of early outpatient remdesivir, focusing on time from symptom onset and number of baseline risk factors (RFs).\nMETHODS\n\n\nPINETREE was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who were randomized within 7\u00a0days of symptom onset and had \u2265 1 RF for disease progression (age\u2009\u2265\u200960\u00a0years, obesity [body mass index\u2009\u2265\u200930], or certain coexisting medical conditions). Patients received remdesivir intravenously (200\u00a0mg on day\u00a01 and 100\u00a0mg on days\u00a02 and 3) or placebo.\nRESULTS\n\n\nIn this subgroup analysis, HTE of remdesivir by time from symptom onset at treatment initiation and number of baseline RFs was not detected. Treatment with remdesivir reduced COVID-19-related hospitalizations independent of stratification by time from symptom onset to randomization. Of patients enrolled\u2009\u2264\u20095\u00a0days from symptom onset, 1/201 (0.5%) receiving remdesivir and 9/194 (4.6%) receiving placebo were hospitalized (hazard ratio [HR] 0.10; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01-0.82). Of those enrolled at >\u20095\u00a0days from symptom onset, 1/78 (1.3%) receiving remdesivir and 6/89 (6.7%) receiving placebo were hospitalized (HR 0.19; 95% CI 0.02-1.61). Remdesivir was also effective in reducing COVID-19-related hospitalizations when stratified by number of baseline RFs for severe disease. Of patients with \u2264\u20092 RFs, 0/159 (0.0%) receiving remdesivir and 4/164 (2.4%) receiving placebo were hospitalized; of those with \u2265\u20093 RFs, 2/120 (1.7%) receiving remdesivir and 11/119 (9.2%) receiving placebo were hospitalized (HR 0.16; 95% CI 0.04-0.73).\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nIn the outpatient setting, benefit of remdesivir initiated within 7\u00a0days of symptoms appeared to be consistent across patients with RFs. Therefore, it may be reasonable to broadly treat patients with remdesivir regardless of comorbidities.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\n\n\nClinicalTrials.gov number NCT04501952.","subreddit_id":"t5_2s23e","post_id":"sd7oxe","stage2_labels":"[{\"crowd-entity-annotation\":{\"entities\":[{\"endOffset\":244,\"label\":\"intervention\",\"startOffset\":236},{\"endOffset\":378,\"label\":\"population\",\"startOffset\":371}]}}]","text":"Anyone take Paxlovid?\nHi everyone - one of my kids just tested positive for Covid so assuming I will as well in the next few days.

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerance to prednisone administered for 3 days in addition to antibiotherapy in patients presenting with an AMRS.\nMETHOD\n\n\nThis was a double blind, randomised study in parallel groups and controlled versus a placebo, involving patients aged over 18, presenting with an AMRS confirmed by X-ray and endoscopy, having developed less than 5 days and complaining of spontaneous pain assessed as >or=50 millimetres on a visual analog scale (VAS). Together with cefpodoxime, the patients received either prednisone (0.8 to 1.2 mg/kg) for 3 days or a placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean of the differences versus the baseline value of pain (MPID - mean pain intensity difference) assessed on the VAS from Day 1 to Day 3. The secondary endpoints assessed were the mean of the differences in intensity of nasal obstruction, assessed in the same way as the MPID, the time lapse before the orally expressed relief of the pain (PRID - pain reflief intensity difference) and the administration of paracetamol during the first 3 days.\nRESULTS\n\n\n289 patients (placebo 147, prednisone 142) were assessable for analysis in intent-to-treat (ITT). The global spontaneous pain on inclusion, measured by a VAS was of 73.0 +/- 14.1 mm. The assessments made during the first 3 days of treatment showed a statistically significant difference in favour of the prednisone group regarding MPID: - 4.82 mm (CI 95% -9.25; -0.40) (p=0.03), nasal obstruction - 5.0 mm (CI 95% -9.1; -0.8) (p=0.02) and consumption of paracetamol (p=0.03).

Pre- and post-treatment gastrointestinal transit measurements were performed in all patients. Patients recorded their bowel function and symptoms daily in a diary during the 10-week study, which was powered to detect a 50% change in the primary colonic transit end-point.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThere were no significant differences in mean gastrointestinal transit measurements, bowel function scores or satisfactory global symptom relief between the two treatment groups, pre- or post-therapy. Differences in abdominal bloating scores between treatments were borderline significant (P = 0.09, analysis of covariance). Further analysis revealed that abdominal bloating was reduced (P = 0.046) with VSL#3 [mean post- minus pre-treatment score, - 13.7; 95% confidence interval (CI), - 2.5 to - 24.9], but not with placebo (P = 0.54) (mean post- minus pre-treatment score, - 1.7; 95% CI, 7.1 to - 10.4).

We investigated the effects of a diet low in FODMAPs compared with an Australian diet, in a randomized, controlled, single-blind, cross-over trial of patients with IBS.\nMETHODS\n\n\nIn a study of 30 patients with IBS and 8 healthy individuals (controls, matched for demographics and diet), we collected dietary data from subjects for 1 habitual week. Participants then randomly were assigned to groups that received 21 days of either a diet low in FODMAPs or a typical Australian diet, followed by a washout period of at least 21 days, before crossing over to the alternate diet. Daily symptoms were rated using a 0- to 100-mm visual analogue scale. Almost all food was provided during the interventional diet periods, with a goal of less than 0.5 g intake of FODMAPs per meal for the low-FODMAP diet. All stools were collected from days 17-21 and assessed for frequency, weight, water content, and King's Stool Chart rating.\nRESULTS\n\n\nSubjects with IBS had lower overall gastrointestinal symptom scores (22.8; 95% confidence interval, 16.7-28.8 mm) while on a diet low in FODMAPs, compared with the Australian diet (44.9; 95% confidence interval, 36.6-53.1 mm; P < .001) and the subjects' habitual diet. Bloating, pain, and passage of wind also were reduced while IBS patients were on the low-FODMAP diet. Symptoms were minimal and unaltered by either diet among controls. Patients of all IBS subtypes had greater satisfaction with stool consistency while on the low-FODMAP diet, but diarrhea-predominant IBS was the only subtype with altered fecal frequency and King's Stool Chart scores.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nIn a controlled, cross-over study of patients with IBS, a diet low in FODMAPs effectively reduced functional gastrointestinal symptoms. This high-quality evidence supports its use as a first-line therapy.\nCLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER\n\n\nACTRN12612001185853.","t5":"Corrigendum to \"A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial: The Efficacy of Multispecies Probiotic Supplementation in Alleviating Symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome Associated with Constipation\".","p5":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1155/2016/4740907.].","a5_doc":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1155/2016/4740907.].","t6":"Therapeutic effects of biobran, modified arabinoxylan rice bran, in improving symptoms of diarrhea predominant or mixed type irritable bowel syndrome: a pilot, randomized controlled study.","p6":"The global assessment was effective in 63.2% of the Biobran group and in 30% of the placebo group (P < 0.05, Biobran group versus placebo group).","a6_doc":"Background. Recently, it was revealed that low grade mucosal inflammation and/or immune imbalance of the lower digestive tract is one of the mechanisms involved in symptom generation in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Biobran, arabinoxylan compound derived from rice bran, has been reported to have several biological actions such as anti-inflammatory and immune modulatory effects. So we investigated the therapeutic effects of Biobran in patients with IBS. Method. Forty patients with diarrhea predominant or mixed type IBS were randomly assigned to either a Biobran group for treatment with Biobran or a placebo group. Therapeutic efficacy and IBS symptoms were assessed subjectively by the patients after 4 weeks of administration. Results. The global assessment was effective in 63.2% of the Biobran group and in 30% of the placebo group (P < 0.05, Biobran group versus placebo group). Biobran group showed a significant decrease in the score of diarrhea and constipation and in CRP value. However, no significant changes were observed in the placebo group. Conclusion. The administration of Biobran improved IBS symptoms.

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) associated with drug therapy in comparison to drug therapy alone on the QOL and symptoms of IBS patients with diarrhea predominance. This study was a randomized clinical trial on 64 IBS patients. The patients were selected according to Rome III criteria and were assigned into two groups. Bowel symptom severity and frequency scale and QOL-IBS were used to investigate the patients' symptoms. The first group underwent CBT with medication therapy, and the second group received only medication. Data were analyzed using analysis of multiple covariance. The two groups showed a significant difference in the QOL-IBS in posttreatment and follow-up stages ( P  < 0.05). There were significant differences in the severity and frequency of IBS symptoms between the two groups after the intervention ( P  < 0.05). However, no significant difference was observed at follow-up stage between the two groups ( P  > 0.05). CBT accompanied by drug therapy can be useful for IBS patients with diarrhea predominance. However, discontinuing this treatment may lead to recurrence of the symptoms.","t8":"A mechanistic multicentre, parallel group, randomised placebo-controlled trial of mesalazine for the treatment of IBS with diarrhoea (IBS-D).","p8":"Mesalazine did not improve abdominal pain, stool consistency nor percentage with satisfactory relief compared with placebo during the last two-weeks follow-up.\n","a8_doc":"INTRODUCTION\n\n\nImmune activation has been reported in the mucosa of IBS patients with diarrhoea (IBS-D), and some small studies have suggested that mesalazine may reduce symptoms.

Patients who fulfilled the Rome III criteria for IBS with no alarm signals were randomly assigned to groups assessed by a strategy of exclusion (analyses of blood, stool samples for intestinal parasites, and sigmoidoscopies with biopsies) or a positive strategy (analyses of blood cell count and C-reactive protein). Patients were followed for 1 year. The primary end point was difference in change of HRQOL from baseline to 1 year between groups (on the basis of the Short Form 36 health survey, physical component summary, and noninferiority margin of 3 points). Secondary outcomes were change in gastrointestinal symptoms, satisfaction with management, and use of resources. Findings of diagnostic misclassification were registered.\nRESULTS\n\n\nA positive strategy was noninferior to a strategy of exclusion (difference, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, -2.74 to 1.45).

Xaggitin XL 18mg ( now on 36mg and then will go to 54mg ). It seems to work ... I wake up a lot easier as before I would wake up groggy and just completely unfunctional .. which would then lead to me being easily distracted etc, and my focus throughout the day seems improved ... mood seems improved ... but, at around 4pm I crash hard and just feel exhausted at night. I had some family over at the weekend and was unable to keep up in conversation. Also after a few days it seems to have less of an effect ... but then I up the dose and it works again. Obviously this won't be sustainable and I will eventually reach max dose.  \n\n\nI would like to try Elvanse next as I've heard people say the come down is less brutal ... but it takes longer to kick in, which is a problem for me as I find it most difficult in the morning. I could wake earlier and take it, and then go back to bed ... or I've also seen some people who take Amfexa as a top up in the morning and then take Elvanse for the rest of the day. This seems totally ideal for me, and has the benefit where I can forgo the meds on weekends if I'm not working / doing much - but have the quick release to fall back on in the event something crops up.  \n\n\nThe question is - can I request this? I scared to accept a med just because it works somewhat, as changing it seems like it would be a pain in the ass .. so I'd like to make an informed decision.. but also don't want to waste their time.

Additionally, patient-, disorder- and treatment-related factors associated with adherence and persistence will be identified.\nMETHOD\n\n\nPost-hoc analysis of the active treatment group of a placebo-controlled, randomised, 24 week trial with MPH-ER with univariate description and multiple logistic regression models and Hosmer and Lemeshow tests.\nRESULTS\n\n\nIn the sample of 241 adults with ADHD (mean age of 35.2 \u00b1 10.1 years), 9.4% of the patients were non-adherent, taking less than 80% of the dispensed medication. Factors associated with non-adherence included age<25 years, education level lower than secondary education, lacking family history of ADHD, lower ADHD baseline severity and lower self- and observer-rated medication efficacy. Lacking family history of ADHD, lower education level and lower self-rated medication efficacy, predicted non-adherence with a prediction accuracy of 16%. Seventeen percent of the patients discontinued early with most discontinuing within the first five weeks of the MPH-ER titration phase. Mean persistence in the discontinuing group was 63.4 \u00b1 49.4 days. Factors associated with discontinuation included male gender, lower education level, lacking family history of ADHD and lower self- and observer-rated medication efficacy. Treatment non-response, male gender and lower education level predicted treatment discontinuation with a prediction accuracy of 22.7%.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nMale adults without relatives with ADHD, with lower educational level and lower self- and observer-rated medication efficacy, who are newly treated with MPH-ER, are at increased risk of non-adherence and treatment discontinuation. Patients are at increased risk of treatment discontinuation during the medication titration phase.","t2":"Stimulant medication withdrawal during long-term therapy in children with comorbid attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and chronic multiple tic disorder.","p2":"There was no change (group data) in the frequency or severity of motor tics or vocal tics during the placebo condition compared with maintenance dose of stimulant medication (ie, no evidence of tic exacerbation while receiving medication or of a withdrawal reaction).","a2_doc":"OBJECTIVES\n\n\nIn this study we examined changes in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder behaviors and motor and vocal tics during withdrawal from long-term maintenance therapy with stimulant medication.\nMETHODS\n\n\nSubjects were 19 children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and chronic tic disorder who had received methylphenidate (n = 17) or dextroamphetamine (n = 2) for a minimum of 1 year. Children were switched to placebo under double-blind conditions. Treatment effects were assessed by using direct observations of child behavior in a simulated (clinic-based) classroom and behavior rating scales completed by parents and clinician.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThere was no change (group data) in the frequency or severity of motor tics or vocal tics during the placebo condition compared with maintenance dose of stimulant medication (ie, no evidence of tic exacerbation while receiving medication or of a withdrawal reaction). There was no evidence of tic exacerbation in the evening as a rebound effect. Treatment with the maintenance dose was also associated with behavioral improvement in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder behaviors, indicating continued efficacy.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nAbrupt withdrawal of stimulant medication in children receiving long-term maintenance therapy does not appear to result in worsening of tic frequency or severity. Nevertheless, these findings do not preclude the possibility of drug withdrawal reactions in susceptible individuals.","t3":"Baseline characteristics of European and non-European adult patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder participating in a placebo-controlled, randomized treatment study with atomoxetine.","p3":"The adult ADHD Quality of Life-Life Outlook and Life Productivity domain scores were significantly different between groups (p\u2264.0004).","a3_doc":"BACKGROUND\n\n\nAttention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often presents as an impairing lifelong condition in adults; yet it is currently underdiagnosed and undertreated in many European countries.

All patients who were enrolled were included in the baseline analyses.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThe demographics for patients in the EUR and NE groups were comparable. Patients in the EUR group had a somewhat lower percentage of prior exposure to psychostimulants compared with the NE group (32.7% vs. 38.9%, p=.0049). Scores on the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale-Investigator Rated: Screening Version with adult ADHD prompts (18-item total, inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive subscales, and index) were comparable.

The principal outcome measures were the Revised Conners' Parent and Teacher Rating Scales.\nRESULTS\n\n\nFifty-three families (73%) returned the follow-up surveys. At 6-9 months, mean T scores were still significantly lower than the mean at baseline for all factors of both the CPRS-R and CTRS-R (P < 0.01). There were no statistically significant differences between scores at 6-9 months and scores at the completion of the corresponding medication period in the crossover trial.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nAfter 6-9 months treatment with stimulant medication, ratings remained significantly better than at baseline.

As nonstimulant treatments are often used after stimulants in ADHD, GXR was assessed relative to prior stimulant treatment in a randomized controlled trial (RCT), in which ATX was included as a reference arm, and in the open-label phase of a randomized-withdrawal study (RWS). Participants were 6-17 years old with ADHD Rating Scale version IV (ADHD-RS-IV) scores \u226532 and Clinical Global Impressions - Severity scores \u22654. RCT participants received dose-optimized GXR (1-7 mg/day), ATX (10-100 mg/day), or placebo for 10-13 weeks. RWS participants received dose-optimized GXR (1-7 mg/day) for 13 weeks. Participants' last stimulant medication prior to enrolment, and reasons for stopping this medication, were collected at baseline. Change from baseline ADHD-RS-IV score and the proportion of responders were assessed by prior stimulant exposure. Of 163 RCT and 296 RWS participants who had previously received stimulant treatment, 142 and 224, respectively, had received methylphenidate (MPH); due to the low number of participants and the heterogeneity of non-MPH treatments, we only report data for prior MPH treatment. The most frequent reasons for stopping MPH were lack of effectiveness or side effects. Placebo-adjusted ADHD-RS-IV changes from baseline were significant in participants receiving GXR (prior MPH, -9.8, P<0.001, effect size [ES] 0.85; stimulant-na\u00efve, -7.6, P<0.001, ES 0.65). In ATX-treated participants, significant placebo-adjusted differences were seen in stimulant-na\u00efve (-5.0, P=0.022, ES 0.43) but not prior MPH-treated (-1.8, P>0.05, ES 0.15) participants. More participants met responder criteria with GXR versus placebo, regardless of prior treatment. GXR response was unaffected by prior stimulant treatment; ATX produced improvement only in stimulant-na\u00efve participants relative to placebo. These findings may be relevant to clinical decision-making regarding sequencing of ADHD treatments.","t6":"Stimulant medication effects in a summer treatment program among young children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.","p6":"RESULTS\n\n\nMethylphenidate had an effect on all four social behaviors and improved two of the three areas of academic functioning.","a6_doc":"OBJECTIVE\n\n\nThis study examined the effectiveness of stimulant medication on multiple domains of functioning in 36 young (5 to 6 years old) children diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\nMETHOD\n\n\nFive- and 6-year-old children attending a summer treatment program between 1987 and 1997 underwent a randomized clinical assessment of the effect of two doses of methylphenidate (0.3 mg/kg versus 0.6 mg/kg) and placebo on social behavior and academic performance.\nRESULTS\n\n\nMethylphenidate had an effect on all four social behaviors and improved two of the three areas of academic functioning. Dose effects were present for three of the seven dependent measures. Individual analyses indicated a therapeutic response rate between 39% and 100% across dependent measures. Furthermore, individual analyses of response indicated that across several important dependent measures, 39% to 98% of children showed little incremental improvement with the higher dose compared with the lower dose of stimulant medication.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nStimulant medication is an effective treatment for young children diagnosed with ADHD; however, multiple domains of functioning must be assessed to determine the most effective dose for young children with ADHD.","t7":"A Placebo-Controlled Trial of Lisdexamfetamine in the Treatment of Comorbid Sluggish Cognitive Tempo and Adult ADHD.","p7":"There were moderately large treatment effects of LDX vs placebo on SCT ratings in both treatment periods (block 1 effect size\u2009=\u20090.68; block 2 effect size\u2009=\u20090.61), which reached significance only in block 1 owing to carryover effects of the first treatment epoch into the second.","a7_doc":"Objective:  To examine the efficacy of lisdexamfetamine (LDX) versus placebo on behavioral attributes of sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and SCT.\nMethods:  In a randomized crossover trial conducted January 2016-April 2018, 38 adults with  DSM-5  ADHD (via the Adult ADHD Clinical Diagnostic Scale v1.2) and SCT were recruited at 2 academic medical centers and assessed for symptoms of ADHD, SCT, executive function deficits, and functional impairment at baseline and weekly during treatment. Participants received 4 weeks of treatment with either LDX (30-70 mg/d; mean\u2009=\u200959.1\u2009\u00b1\u200914.8 mg/d) or matching placebo (mean\u2009=\u200966.6\u2009\u00b1\u20099.1 mg/d) with a 2-week washout before switching to the other arm.

This investigation may bear special importance for an adolescent (as opposed to child) population, because hormonal and metabolism differences between sexes are most likely to emerge at this time. Male (n = 19) and female (n = 16) adolescents, ages 16-19 with ADHD, participated in a randomized, double-blind crossover study evaluating the effectiveness of osmotic-release methylphenidate, extended release amphetamine salts, placebo, and routine limited medication regimen. Medication efficacy was evaluated using ADHD symptom ratings from adolescent self-report and parent report, along with objective measures of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity during driving performance and neuropsychological tasks. Males and females were largely equivalent in impairment, and medication was similarly effective in reducing symptoms. No interactions were found between sex and medication on any measure of effectiveness or side effects. This finding suggests that the efficacy and tolerability of extended-release stimulant medications is equivalent for male and female adolescents with ADHD.","t9":"Children with ADHD and motor dysfunction compared with children with ADHD only.","p9":"Both groups of children had a linear dose response to medication (placebo, low, high) and there was no evidence of a group by dose interaction or an overall group effect at home or school.","a9_doc":"The purpose of this study was to identify group differences in children with attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder and motor dysfunction (ADHD-MD) and ADHD only, and to evaluate the medication responsiveness of ADHD-MD. Sixty-three children (49 males and 14 females; mean age 9 years 10 months, SD 2 years 10 months) underwent a triple blind, placebo-controlled crossover study evaluating two dose levels of methylphenidate (0.3 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED], twice daily) and placebo. Forty-nine trials were completed. Nineteen were children with ADHD-MD, 44 had ADHD only. Behavior and functioning were assessed at home and at school. Treatment effects were assessed using the Abbreviated Symptom Questionnaire for Parents and Teachers. Children with ADHD-MD were more likely to have severe ADHD-combined type and other neurodevelopmental and behavioral problems. Both groups of children had a linear dose response to medication (placebo, low, high) and there was no evidence of a group by dose interaction or an overall group effect at home or school. The lack of group effect suggests that these children responded to medication like the other subgroups.","t10":"Efficacy of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate for promoting occupational success in adolescents and young adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.","p10":"Ratings of job application quality, job interview performance, and delivery outcomes were not significantly different on medication versus placebo.","a10_doc":"There has been a lack of research on the third area of impairment noted in the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition -\"occupational functioning.\" It is important to understand the impact of common treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in occupational settings. Twenty individuals with ADHD between ages 16 and 25 participated in a double-blind, placebo controlled evaluation of 40 mg lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in a setting designed to approximate a restaurant workplace with associated, simulated food delivery. Outcome measures included ratings of performance, as well as behavioral productivity. Results indicated that participants completed more workplace tasks when on medication, relative to placebo. Ratings of job application quality, job interview performance, and delivery outcomes were not significantly different on medication versus placebo. These results suggest positive effects of medication in a workplace environment, but also a need for study of additional interventions to support workplace-related behavior and functioning.

It seems to work ... I wake up a lot easier as before I would wake up groggy and just completely unfunctional .. which would then lead to me being easily distracted etc, and my focus throughout the day seems improved ... mood seems improved ... but, at around 4pm I crash hard and just feel exhausted at night. I had some family over at the weekend and was unable to keep up in conversation. Also after a few days it seems to have less of an effect ... but then I up the dose and it works again. Obviously this won't be sustainable and I will eventually reach max dose.  \n\n\nI would like to try Elvanse next as I've heard people say the come down is less brutal ... but it takes longer to kick in, which is a problem for me as I find it most difficult in the morning. I could wake earlier and take it, and then go back to bed ... or I've also seen some people who take Amfexa as a top up in the morning and then take Elvanse for the rest of the day. This seems totally ideal for me, and has the benefit where I can forgo the meds on weekends if I'm not working / doing much - but have the quick release to fall back on in the event something crops up.  \n\n\nThe question is - can I request this? I scared to accept a med just because it works somewhat, as changing it seems like it would be a pain in the ass .. so I'd like to make an informed decision.. but also don't want to waste their time. I'm also scared to even mention Amfexa for fear of being labeled as someone just wanting a high.","a1_anno":0,"a2_anno":0,"a3_anno":0,"a4_anno":0,"a5_anno":0,"a6_anno":0,"a7_anno":0,"a8_anno":0,"a9_anno":0,"a10_anno":0,"TS_PICOR":[{"Punchline":"Treatment non-response, male gender and lower
